I sort of shit on SL and SS a lot here, and I've found myself explaining why repeatedly, so I figured I'd make an effortpost with critique/solutions.

[tldr](http://i.imgur.com/SKruJBF.png)

StrongLifts and Starting Strength might be the most often-recommended programs on this subreddit, and they’re pretty good at introducing new lifters to the gym. However, if you plan on using them to gain strength or muscle mass, they’re poor options.

Many of you might say you’ve ran SL and SS and got fine results, but that’s not really what makes a good program for a new lifter. New lifters can see results from doing damn near anything. A good beginner program gets you results _efficiently_. So, here’s why I believe the base SL and SS programs are suboptimal, and how you should tweak them. To keep things simple, I’ll be focusing my critiques on SL, but the majority carries over to SS as well.

1: _Lack of frequency_

This one is especially funny since SL is often referred to as a high-frequency program. I disagree with that label. Over a two-week period, you hit your pecs, biceps, and shoulders (the muscles most guys care about for aesthetics) only three times. Elevated muscle protein synthesis, the driver of hypertrophy ([1](https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/musclesgrowLK.html)), lasts roughly 36 hours after training ([2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8563679)). Since you should keep protein synthesis elevated as much as possible, averaging 112 hours between muscle stimuli as SL does is far from optimal. Even while controlling for volume and intensity, high frequency generally beats out low frequency for both muscle and strength development ([3](http://strengtheory.com/high-frequency-training-for-a-bigger-total-research-on-highly-trained-norwegian-powerlifters/)).

Fix: Bench and Overhead Press every workout.

2: _Lack of volume_

Increase in muscle mass trends logarithmically over time, meaning beginner lifters can gain the most muscle in the least amount of time. This is important even if you’re only interested in strength, because increasing your muscle mass is the best way to increase your strength ([4](http://strengtheory.com/powerlifters-should-train-more-like-bodybuilders/)). Researchers recommend a minimum of ten weekly sets for each muscle to see good results ([8](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2016.1210197))- SL gives you 7.5 for pecs, shoulders, and biceps, and 1.5 for hamstrings. This means increasing sets ([5](http://strengtheory.com/more-is-more/)) and reps per set ([6](http://strengtheory.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/)) are the best ways to maximize both aesthetic and strength progress.

Fix: Do more sets and more reps when possible.

3: _Lack of bicep involvement_

Rows and cleans alone aren’t great at growing biceps. Your biceps are only secondary muscles involved in the movements, meaning they won’t really be taken anywhere close to failure. Since number of sets near muscular failure is the primary factor when inspiring protein synthesis ([6](http://strengtheory.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/)), your bicep development will be subpar if you don’t fix this.

Fix:	Ideally, add Chin-Ups. Not only do they hit the biceps hard, but the extra back work will balance out your increased benching. If you can’t do Chin-Ups, do 30° Bent-Over Rows with supinated grip, which shifts emphasis to the biceps ([7](http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/pull-up-vs-chin-up-a-comparison-and-analysis)).

4: _Poopoo lower body programming_

If you’re mainly interested in aesthetics, SL is probably a bit squat-heavy for you. If you’re mainly interested in strength, 1x5 deadlifts three times every two weeks is a bad plan. Taking the time to warm up and load the bar, only to perform one serious set is not an efficient way to spend your time. The idea that you should only do 1 set because CNS fatigue is silly. SL is made for beginners using light weight. CNS fatigue is not an issue for them. The idea that you should only do 1 set to avoid form breakdown is flawed as well. The programs are designed to eventually push you to form breakdown regardless of how many sets you’ve performed, so that’s inevitable. On top of all of this, Deadlifts are really the only exercise in the program that hit your hamstrings (no, Squats don’t to a significant degree [[9](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19130646)])- why give them a measly 3 total sets every two weeks?

Fix: Squat less, Deadlift more. The increased leg work from Deadlifts will make up for decreasing Squats.

5: _No periodization_

This one’s simple: Not varying your rep ranges is sub-optimal for both strength and hypertrophy progress ([10](http://strengtheory.com/in-defense-of-program-hoppers-dup-revisited/)). SL sacrifices this great strategy in the name of simplicity. I think you can handle a little variation. You’re not stupid.

Fix: Vary your rep ranges.

6: _Boring start_

If you’re healthy and just getting into lifting, it can take you a considerable amount of time to get to challenging weights following the typical SL progression scheme. Going so long without being challenged will have new lifters quitting before they even start touching real weights.

Fix: Use infrequent AMRAP (as many reps as possible) sets to determine progression speed.

Applying all the changes I suggested, you get something like this:

The weight progression is a tiny bit more complicated, but I think most are willing to put in a few minutes of extra thought in exchange for better progress. Since your 8 rep weight should be ~90% of your 4 rep weight, your 4 rep weight would begin at 50lb if you want to start with the bar for 8 rep sets.

Here are some questions I anticipate:

_Why 4 sets?_  
To respect time constraints. Do 5 if you want.

_I can’t do Chin-Ups?_  
30° Bent-Over Rows with supinated grip.

_I can do more than 4/8 Chin-Ups?_  
Weighted Chin-Ups.

_How much do I deload after failure?_  
No change here. 10% as a beginner.

_How do I progress?_  
Smallest incremental jumps possible between workouts to meet the weekly goal.

_Why alternate Squats and Deadlift days?_  
Deadlifting after Squatting sucks, and doing both on the same day would take a lot of time. Do both every day if you want. I also didn’t want to suggest something like 2 sets of each lift every day because that would become inefficient when you factor in warming up, loading the bar, waiting for a rack, etc.

_Why not alternate starting Overhead Press vs starting Bench?_  
Doing so would introduce fluctuating levels of fatigue to the lifts, which I don’t think is appropriate %RM based linear progression program. It can definitely work if you used RPE to autoregulate your weights, but I don’t think beginners have the experience necessary to do so.  
I opted to start Bench because more people care about Bench. Start Overhead Press if you want.
