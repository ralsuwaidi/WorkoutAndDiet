[themify_box icon="warning"]

_“The change to a [low carb diet] in patients taking medications for diabetes or hypertension should be made under supervision by clinicians. (...) Frequently, a reduction in medication will be required to avoid hypoglycemia and hypotension due to overmedication.“_ - [Westman et al., 2007](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/2/276.full)

_“Because of the effectiveness of carbohydrate restriction on glycemic control, there is a danger of hypoglycemia for those patients on glucose-lowering medication. It is recommended that medication be reduced in advance of initiating a low-carbohydrate diet.”_ - [Feinman et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25287761)
