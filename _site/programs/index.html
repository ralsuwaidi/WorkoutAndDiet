<h1 id="how-do-i-choose-the-right-routine-for-my-goals%3F">How do I choose the right routine for my goals? <a class="direct-link" href="#how-do-i-choose-the-right-routine-for-my-goals%3F">#</a></h1>
<!-- .entry-header -->
<p>The choice of a workout routine is one of the most heavily debated topics, bar none, especially among those who are just getting started. It can often feel overwhelming or like you have no idea what’s right for your goals and situation, what’s the most effective or efficient, or who to trust. We often see posters saying they feel that there is a lot of conflicting information on how best to achieve your goals, and that they’re afraid of choosing the wrong program and wasting their time.</p>
<p>The truth is that there seems to be a lot of conflicting information because there are many roads that lead to Rome, and this choice doesn’t matter as much as you may think it does.</p>
<p><strong>Effort and consistency over time in both training and eating in accordance with your goals are, by miles, more important than what specific routine you choose.</strong> People on the internet tend to get very dogmatic about the methods that worked <em>for them</em>, but most all of the training methods you can find work – if you give them time and genuine effort – and you can see this demonstrated for yourself by reviewing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=progress+OR+transformation&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">the many years of progress posts on r/Fitness</a>, <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/intermediate-advanced-resources/program-review-archive/">program reviews from r/weightroom</a>, and testimonies everywhere all across the internet. For just about every training method there is, you can find someone who used it and got the results they wanted – including some of the most cockamamie home grown routines imaginable.</p>
<p>The other important reality to keep in mind is that <strong>different individuals can respond better to different methods of training, and there is no way to know in advance what <em>you</em> will respond best to.</strong> You have to be willing to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/c89k0n/crystal_balls_do_not_exist/">try things, genuinely work at them, and see what results that they give you.</a> This includes not getting lost in the weeds trying to firehose yourself with all the scientific studies out there about training to make a decision – because as Greg Nuckols points out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dfeflr/group_data_dont_tell_you_much_about_individuals/">group data doesn’t tell you much about individuals</a> (ie, you).  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/dfewmp/thinking_about_ditching_your_program_read_this/">Dr. Mike Israetel also has an excellent piece</a> that is relevant here, in which he discusses the importance of giving changes to your training enough time to bear fruit.</p>
<p>So, in that light, the most important factors to consider are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have access to all of the equipment that the routine requires, or can make reasonable substitutions.</li>
<li>If you can handle the time investment the routine requires – in session time, number of days per week, and schedule layout (ie: Mon/Wed/Fri, Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that the most important factor in your results is consistency in effort over time. Therefore, the most important things to consider when choosing a routine are the ones that can most negatively impact your ability to be consistent in your effort. Don’t get married to a six day routine if you know that a three day routine will fit better into your life and schedule just because you fear missing out on gains. A routine that you can stick with for a long period of time because it has fewer days a week will get you much better results than one that you can’t follow consistently.</p>
<p>The routines that have been compiled in this Wiki come by recommendation across multiple communities – they have all been vetted and used by many people, successfully, to achieve the fitness results they wanted. Many have been created by accomplished, reputable coaches with proven track records. It really is as simple as picking literally anything you find here and bust your ass at it for six months or more. It is impossible for you to waste your time on any of these routines unless you sandbag or eat like a dummy.</p>

<h1 id="comment-on-beginner-programs">Comment On Beginner Programs <a class="direct-link" href="#comment-on-beginner-programs">#</a></h1>
<p>Most beginner programs that are common in strength training are poorly designed. If you look at how legitimate coaches like Sheiko program for beginners, the programs are lower specificity, high number of accessories, and lower relative intensity compared to things programs from people like Rippetoe, Phrak, etc. Sheiko's beginner training philosophy also emphasizes multiple fitness qualities and a variety of movement patterns.</p>
<p>If you read Science and Practice of Strength Training, Zatsiorsky also advises a similar training philosophy for beginners. He suggests new lifters spend several months doing general preparatory exercises before moving on to more challenging and intense lifting variations. Yet, for whatever reason, this concept preached by actual coaches with an advanced education in the field are lost to droves of r/fitness users and coaches who don't even understand basic biomechanics like Rippetoe.</p>
<p>Beginners should not be training with 85%+ in competition lifts multiple times a week, peaking these movements by continually adding 5-10lbs every single training session until they plateau. Beginners should not be training with only one rep range and with an extremely limited movement selection. Beginners should not be ignoring all other physical and motor qualities in favor of only developing maximal strength. Why this needs to be said in 2017 is absolutely baffling.</p>
<p>In no other sport are beginner athletes taken into practice on their first day and asked to perform high intensity, high complexity movements while ignoring GPP, motor development in a variety of skills, and a whole slew of other things that go into making a good athlete. Imagine taking a 13 year old shot putter and asking them to throw at 80-85% of their max distance three times a week their first season even stepping on the field? It's asinine.</p>
<p>So what should beginners actually be doing based on actual well educated coaches and exercise scientists in the field?</p>
<p>Training with intensities ~60-70%, using easier lift regressions with a plan to eventually move to competition lifts, varying volume and intensity throughout the week, little to no loading at our near failure in technical lifts, using a variety of bilateral and unlitateral movements to train all joint actions to develop a balanced physique, and training other fitness qualities like aerobic endurance, muscular endurance, mobility, etc.</p>
<p>I would recommend beginner lifters focus on box squats, goblet squats, kb deadlifts, trap bar deadlifts, lunges, and kb swings for lower body strength development. For the upper body, assisted pull ups, push ups, db rows, neutral grip db presses, unilateral db presses, and renegade rows for upper body strength development. For accessories, hamstring curls, back raises, planks, ab wheel, landmine presses, band pull aparts, reverse hypers, and face pulls. You don't have to do all of these movements, these are just some ideas. A complete beginner who never exercised before would use a bodyweight box squat, whereas a 13 year old who has played sports might use a DB goblet squat, for example.</p>
<p>If you aren't a powerlifter, you also don't need to use the barbell bench/squat/deadlift despite what r/fitness will tell you. A trap bar deadlift, safety bar squat, and football bar bench are fine choices that will develop sufficient strength in the hips and shoulder girdle, while reducing some injury risk to the low back and glenohumeral joint.</p>
<p>Beginners should also prioritize conditioning and GPP. Sled pushing and pulling and cycling are the easiest and low impact.</p>
<p>One more thing that absolutely needs to be said. <strong>HOW FAST YOU ADD WEIGHT TO THE BAR IS NOT THE BE ALL END ALL OF ATHLETIC DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not you squat 225 in 3 months or 1 year is largely irrelevant to the totality of an athletic career. Whether or not you excel in a sport isn't determined by how much progress you make in 10 weeks, it's almost always determined by how much progress you make in 10+ years. People who only view progress as the amount of weight you can immediately add to a bar simply do not understand all that goes into athletic development. Injury prevention, both in the short term and long term is a much more important aspect of athletic development than adding 50 lbs to your squat in 1 month.</p>

<p>This page lists routines that are most commonly recommended by r/Fitness users for building strength and muscle. However, it is by far not a complete list of all effective routines, and there are many more out there that will serve you just as well. For some more options, you can also have a look over the <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/intermediate-advanced-resources/program-review-archive/">Program Review Archive</a>.</p>
<p>All of the programs on this page are effective at getting you both bigger and stronger, provided you <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/">eat to support it</a>. A bigger muscle is a stronger muscle and vice versa. While the overlap is certainly not 100%, don’t fall into the trap of thinking getting bigger and getting stronger are mutually exclusive goals that require wildly different training methods – especially if it is based on the outdated concept of <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/faq/what-are-the-different-repetition-ranges-good-for/">special rep ranges</a>.</p>
<p>As you make your choice, don’t forget the importance of having at least some cardio in your overall fitness plan, even if it’s not your primary focus. Read more about the benefits here: <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/adding-physical-activity/#Why_You_Should_Do_Cardio">Why You Should Do Cardio</a></p>
