## Calories

Estimate your approximate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) as a starting point for how many calories to eat each day. There are many calculators you can find online - Don't be concerned with specific numbers or accuracy, this is just an estimate to use as a starting point.
We strongly recommend the 3-Suns Adaptive TDEE Spreadsheet. It will give you an estimate as a starting point, and as you enter your weight and calories consumed each day, it will calibrate and give you a more accurate picture of your TDEE over time.
Begin tracking everything you eat using a site such as MyFitnessPal or NutritionData.
To lose weight, you must eat fewer calories than your TDEE - a deficit.
To gain weight, you must eat more calories than your TDEE - a surplus.
The most common recommendation is +/- 250-500 calories from your estimated TDEE. Expect to change this over time as your weight changes.
