&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has now undergone its fourth major revision on 3/26/2020. Most sections have been added to or rewritten. A few sections have been removed. Only the early sections on protein synthesis/anabolic signaling and early meta-analyses have remained the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tl%3Bdr-version&quot;&gt;TL;DR Version &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#tl%3Bdr-version&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average, muscle growth tends to be best around 6-8 hard sets per muscle group per training session when taking long rests. That can be 12 - 24 weekly sets for a frequency of 2-3 days per week. Volume needs may be double this when taking short rests, but the max muscle growth is still around the same so there&#39;s no advantage to doing short rests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual results may vary substantially from these averages, with some individuals having volume ceilings much higher than 8 sets per session or 20 weekly sets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume increases are best done in small (20%) increments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-takeaways&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated meta-analytic data shows a logarithmic relationship between training volume and hypertrophy in a single session. Gains increase rapidly at small volumes and there is diminishing returns as you get to higher session volumes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average, hypertrophy appears to increase with increasing volumes of up to 6-8 hard sets in a single training session when taking long rests between sets, with a plateau at higher volumes. This is approximately 12 - 24 weekly sets when training each muscle 2-3 days per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual results may vary substantially from these averages, with some individuals having volume ceilings much higher than 8 sets per session or 20 weekly sets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s an interaction between set volume and rest intervals. Since short rest intervals may impair hypertrophy for a given set volume, you have to do more hard sets to make up for it. Thus, volume requirements may be approximately twice that of long rest intervals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a volume/frequency interaction. There is some evidence of a maximum effective dose per training session, although it will vary from one individual to the next. To increase weekly volume, rather than continuing to increase volume above this ceiling per session, it&#39;s better to split weekly volume up into higher frequency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some evidence indicates that there are less non-responders with higher volumes, and that people tend to be more responsive when increasing their volume relative to what they were doing before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When increasing set volume, it is best to do it in small increments (20%).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that people tend to be more responsive when increasing volume relative to what they were doing before, there is a theoretical case for cycling set volume. This would involve slowly increasing volume over time to the highest effective per-session volume until a performance plateau is reached. Volume would then be decreased to a maintenance level for a period of time to re-sensitize the muscle to a volume stimulus. Volume would eventually be increased again, and this pattern would be repeated over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of training volume, genetics play a strong role in hypertrophy. People who respond well to low volume will also tend to respond well to high volume, and people who don&#39;t respond well to low volume will likely still be a low responder to high volume (although the response will likely be improved).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-application&quot;&gt;Practical Application &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#practical-application&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardgainers may benefit from increasing their volume, compared to the popular strategy of reducing volume and frequency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When taking long rests (2+ minutes), per-session volumes of around 6-8 sets per muscle group will likely produce the best hypertrophy on average in trained subjects, although individual results and needs may vary dramatically from that average. Set volume may need to be double that when taking short rests (&amp;lt;=90 seconds).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The classic &amp;quot;bro-split&amp;quot; of blasting a muscle group for very high volumes (like 20 sets) once per week is likely an inferior way to train, and it is better to split the volume up into frequencies of 2-3 days per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&#39;re training a muscle group twice per week with long rests, 12-16 weekly sets is likely a good range to give you the best &amp;quot;bang for your buck&amp;quot; when considering results versus time investment, although individual needs will vary. Some individuals may need volumes substantially higher than this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU MUST CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHEN PROGRAMMING VOLUME, including schedule, volume tolerance, recovery ability, available time to train, importance of achieving maximal hypertrophy, injury history, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum number of effective sets may be impacted by rest intervals, types of exercise used (compound versus isolation), and previous training volumes. Shorter rest intervals (90 seconds or less) with compound movements may require more sets to get the same response (and thus not necessarily save any time).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who have plateaued on low-to-moderate training volumes may benefit from an increase in training volume.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases in set volume should be small (around 20%).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This data doesn&#39;t suggest you train with high volumes all the time.  Periods of low volume training may be necessary to help with recovery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A volume cycling approach may be beneficial. In this approach, set volume is slowly increased over a period of time, until a maximum effective amount is achieved. This could be where successive 20% increases in set volume fails to stimulate further gains. Once this plateau is reached at this high volume, volume is reduced to a maintenance level (2-4 sets per muscle per session, 2-3 times per week) for a period of time to re-sensitize the muscle to a volume stimulus. Set volume is then ramped back up to the maximum effective dose, and the volume cycle is repeated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many sets should I do?&amp;quot; is probably one of the most common questions that people have when trying to build muscle.  In fact, the number of sets you should do to build muscle can be such a point of contention that people have fought &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/a-h-i-t-less-at-bat-part-1-my-response-to-carpinellis-review-of-my-strength-meta-analysis/&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27805470&quot;&gt;journal article wars&lt;/a&gt; over it.  Entire training philosophies (i.e., &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/h-i-t-pocrisy-part-1/&quot;&gt;High Intensity Training and Heavy Duty&lt;/a&gt;) have been built around how many sets people think you should do.  In fact, for years, people have been arguing over whether you should train with a low number of sets, or high number of sets, to maximize muscle hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach, of course, is to examine the scientific evidence, and consider where the overall weight of the evidence lies.  In regards to training volume, it&#39;s not that easy, due to the limitations in the existing research.  Still, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t come up with some solid evidence-based recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do We Mean by Set?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to clarify is what we mean by a &amp;quot;set.&amp;quot;  In a weight training workout, there are a lot of ways you can do a set, from a warm-up set that hardly pushes you to failure, to a gut-busting set of 20-rep squats to failure.  In this article, a set is going to be defined as a set of moderate to high repetitions (approximately 8 reps or more) to muscular failure or near failure.  I use this definition because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928218&quot;&gt;high load, low rep sets do not produce as much hypertrophy as more moderate 8-12 rep sets&lt;/a&gt;, despite an equivalent number of hard sets.  However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853914&quot;&gt;moderate-rep and high-rep sets to failure are similar in their impacts on muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, a set should be to near muscular failure, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/research-review-to-fail-or-not-to-fail-part-2-the-impact-of-training-to-failure-on-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;stopping well short of failure will impair muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  Finally, a set counts towards a particular muscle group if that muscle group can be considered a prime mover in the exercise that is being used.  For example, 3 sets of bench press will count as 3 sets for triceps, since the triceps are active prime movers in a bench press.  Three sets of bench press, and 3 sets of tricep pushdowns, would count as 6 total sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Muscle Protein Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first places we can look for evidence is in the impact of set volume on muscle protein synthesis.  Remember that resistance training stimulates protein synthesis, the process by which your muscles build new protein.  When this process of protein synthesis exceeds the rate of protein breakdown, your muscles grow.  The elevation in protein synthesis happens very quickly after a training session, and continues for 24-48 hours after the session.  If set volume impacts muscle hypertrophy, then it would stand to reason that it may impact muscle protein synthesis as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581041&quot;&gt;One study that examined the impact of set volume on muscle protein synthesis came out of the lab of Stu Phillips&lt;/a&gt;.  The researchers compared 3 sets of leg extensions to 1 set of leg extensions.  Both groups trained at 70% 1-RM to muscular failure.  Fed-state muscle protein synthesis (the amount of protein your muscles make after you eat a meal, which is really important when it comes to building muscle size) was elevated by almost twice the amount in the 3-set group compared to the 1-set group.  Protein synthesis was still elevated by 130% at 29 hours after the training session in the 3-set group, but was back to normal in the 1 set group.  In other words, muscles were not only making more protein soon after the workout with 3 sets to failure, but they were still making more protein 29 hours later compared to 1 set.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27219125&quot;&gt;Since muscle protein synthesis correlates with gains in muscle size once you get past the initial muscle damage&lt;/a&gt;, this would imply that 3 sets is better than 1 set for putting on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/set-volume-muscle-protein-synthesis.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/set-volume-muscle-protein-synthesis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22859389&quot;&gt;In another study looking at the impact of set number on muscle protein synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, 6 sets of 8 reps at 75% 1-RM on the leg extension caused greater muscle protein synthesis up to 2 hours after the training session, as compared to 3 sets.  This was true in both young and old subjects.  Also, in the older (but not the younger) subjects, 6 sets of 14 reps at 40% 1-RM caused a greater muscle protein synthesis response compared to 3 sets.  There are two major problems with this study.  First, subjects did not train to failure...8 reps at 75% 1-RM, and 14 reps at 40% 1-RM, can be far short of failure for some individuals on a leg extension.  Second, the researchers only measured protein synthesis out to 4 hours.  Thus, this study might suggest that 6 sets per muscle group is better than 3 for muscle protein synthesis, but there are a lot of limitations to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268828&quot;&gt;In a third study by Damas and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, 12 sets to failure with 2 minute rests on the quadriceps (6 sets of leg press and 6 sets of leg extensions) only caused a small increase in muscle protein synthesis compared to 8 sets to failure (4 sets of each exercise) in trained subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/damas-muscle-protein-synthesis-set-volume.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Damas et al. (2019). VAR-sets did 12 sets in quadriceps, while CON did 8 sets. The increase in muscle protein synthesis from the additional 4 sets was very small, and was not related to hypertrophy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small increase in muscle protein synthesis was not associated with greater hypertrophy over 8 weeks, suggesting that the small increase may have been more due to a small increase in muscle damage. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This data suggests that muscle protein synthesis may begin to plateau somewhere in the 8-12 set range.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;one rodent study found that muscle protein synthesis increased with an increasing number of &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; of electrically stimulated muscle contractions, statistically plateauing at 5 sets but the raw mean peaked at 10 sets&lt;/a&gt;.  Protein synthesis tended to be lower at 20 sets.  However, a &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; in this study may not be equivalent to a a set as we define it.  There are also other differences &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;which I described in a research review&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of these differences, this data does align nicely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268828&quot;&gt;the previous study by Damas et al.&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a plateau in muscle protein synthesis somewhere around 10 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these studies, &lt;strong&gt;we can say that multiple sets will create more protein synthesis than single sets to failure, and it looks like the response may plateau between 8-12 sets in a session on average.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Anabolic Signaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place we can look is the impact of set volume on anabolic signaling.  When you train with weights, the tension on your muscles sends molecular signals to muscle cells to start creating new protein.  One important molecular signal is called p70S6K phosphorylation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130904&quot;&gt;which has been found to correlate with gains in muscle size when measured 5 hours after a training session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some studies that have examined the impact of set volume on p70S6K phosphorylation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25861013&quot;&gt; One study showed 10 sets of 10 RM (leg press, 2 min rest) resulted in greater p70S6K phosphorylation compared to 5 sets of 10 RM when measured 30 minutes after the session&lt;/a&gt;.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581041&quot;&gt;the protein synthesis study out of Stu Phillips&#39;s lab that was mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, p70S6K phosphorylation was significantly elevated at 29 hours after 3 sets of leg extensions, but not 1 set.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617335&quot;&gt;In a third study&lt;/a&gt;, 3 sets of 6 RM of a leg press resulted in a threefold elevation of p70S6k phosphorylation, and 5 sets of 6 RM resulted in a sixfold elevation (i.e., double the response). &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;In the rodent study mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, p70S6K phosphorylation continued to increase with increasing &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; volume up to 20, although &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; here cannot be considered equivalent to human sets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In a fifth study&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorylated S6K were 19% greater with 6 sets per muscle group performed in a training session versus 2 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another molecular anabolic signal we can look at is the mechanistic target of rapcomycin or mTOR, a protein that regulates muscle protein synthesis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In this study&lt;/a&gt;, 6 sets per muscle group per session resulted in 12% higher phosphorylation of mTOR compared to 2 sets. In this same study, the higher volume resulted in a 28% greater phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s6, another signaling molecule involved in muscle protein synthesis. The higher volume also caused greater levels of RNA (a marker of creation of ribosomes, which are the site of protein synthesis) and transcription factor c-Myc, which is important in initiating RNA transcription (one of the steps in muscle protein synthesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the anabolic signaling data tells us that &amp;quot;more is better&amp;quot; in terms of sets, but it doesn&#39;t give us an optimal range or tell us when &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; becomes &amp;quot;too much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Satellite Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle fibers have nuclei, which are the control centers for these muscle fibers and contain important genetic information.  To repair or build new muscle fibers, you need new nuclei.  Enter satellite cells, which are dormant cells located outside of muscle fibers.  When a muscle fiber is damaged, satellite cells donate their nuclei to allow the fibers to be repaired and grow.  Thus, satellite cells are an important component in the process of muscle hypertrophy.  Thus, if set volume impacts muscle size, then one mechanism through how it does so may be through satellite cell activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22417199&quot;&gt;Only one study has looked at the impact of set volume on satellite cell activation&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study, 3 sets of leg press and 3 sets of leg extension (6 sets for quadriceps total done 3 times per week, or 18 total weekly sets) resulted in greater satellite cell activation than 1 set of leg press and 1 set of leg extension (2 sets for quadriceps per session, or 6 weekly sets).  This was accompanied by a much greater increase in leg extension 1-RM strength as well (48% versus 29%).  This would suggest that a total weekly set volume in the teens might be better than single digits, at least for legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers also looked at satellite cell activation in the trapezius, as well as shoulder press strength.  They did not observe any impact of set volume on either satellite cell activity or shoulder press strength.  However, given that the trapezius is not a prime mover in the upper body exercises used in this study (seated chest press, seated rowing, lat pulldown biceps curl, and shoulder press), the satellite cell activity in the trapezius may not give us sufficient information as to the impact of set volume on satellite cells in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this data would suggest that a weekly set volume in the teens is likely better for hypertrophy than single digits, at least for the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Biopsies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all of this data only tells us that, if you want to gain as much size as possible, multiple sets per muscle group are better than single sets, more sets are better than less (to a point), and weekly volume in the teens may be better than in the single digits.  But this is all based on extrapolation from data derived from muscle biopsies.  Ultimately, we need to look at what happens to changes in muscle size when you put people on training programs with different set volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair number of studies have been done over the past few decades, that have looked at changes in muscle size when comparing different set volumes.  Results have varied, with some studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) showing more muscle gain with more sets, while other studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8897390&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) showing no significant difference with more sets.  Differences in outcomes between studies might relate to differences in study design, in populations used, in training volume, in training frequency, etc.  However, another key factor that may explain the differences is one of sample size (i.e., the number of subjects in each study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of why sample size may impact the results, let&#39;s say you want to do a study that compares low volume training to high volume training.  You need to know how many people you should recruit to your study.  So, you do what is called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;power analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This gives you an approximation of how many subjects you will need to successfully detect a particular difference between groups.  To do a power analysis, you need an idea of what sort of difference you are interested in seeing.  For example, perhaps you think that high volume training will give you double the muscle gains.  You then use data from previous research to get an idea of what the typical level of muscle gain in a study happens to be, and how much it tends to vary from one person to the next.  This data goes into the power analysis, and you end up with an estimate of how many people you are going to need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go through this power analysis exercise with some real world data.  Direct measurements of muscle size (like ultrasound) are superior to indirect measurements (body composition techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-6-dexa/&quot;&gt;DEXA&lt;/a&gt;), so we&#39;ll stick with data that uses those types of measurements.  Typical changes in muscle thickness, assessed by ultrasound, tend to be around 5-10% over a typical 8-12 week study.  So, let&#39;s say I think a low volume group might experience a 5% change in muscle thickness, and a high volume group might experience a 10% increase in muscle thickness.  Essentially, I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;ll get double the gains with high volume over low volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the number of subjects that I need?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26605807&quot;&gt;Using data from a rest interval study I collaborated on with Brad Schoenfeld, Menno Henselmans, and others&lt;/a&gt;, and then running the data through some online power analysis software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org/&quot;&gt;GLIMMPSE&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would need approximately 100 subjects per group to declare a 5% versus 10% gain in muscle size as statistically significant, 80% of the time!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  If I reduce this to 50% of the time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would still need about 50 subjects per group!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if I did 100 studies, and wanted to be able to declare a doubling of muscle size as statistically significant in only 50 of those studies, I would need 50 subjects per group!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what is the typical sample size of most weight training studies?  Maybe 8-15 subjects per group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look at the statistical power if you only had 10 subjects per group.  Running the same data through GLIMMPSE, I get a statistical power of approximately 30%.  This means that, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with only 10 subjects per group, you will declare a 5 versus 10% gain in muscle size as statistically significant in only 30 out of 100 studies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most weight training studies on volume are essentially set up to fail to detect important differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Changes in muscle size are small, and vary a lot from one person to the next, and so you need HUGE differences between groups to detect a difference over a typical 8-12 week study that only has around 10 people per group.  But the reality is that the impact of doubling your training volume isn&#39;t going to result in 3-4 times the gains.  It &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; result in a doubling of gains, but, as you just learned, most weight training studies have sample sizes that are simply too small to detect even that amount.  This is why you see disparate results among studies.  Some will successfully detect a difference based on random chance alone, while others will miss a difference, even if a true difference exists (in statistics, this is called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;type 2 error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or false negative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of a possible type 2 error.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues looked at the effects of weight training set volume on muscle size&lt;/a&gt;.  They compared three volume levels:  low, medium, and high.  The following table shows the percentage gains in muscle size, as well as the effect size (a measurement of the meaningfulness of an effect), for each group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ostrowski.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ostrowski-1024x321.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, double-digit weekly set volumes resulted in approximately double the muscle gains (the orange cells), but these differences were not statistically significant.  Why would this happen?  This study only had 9 subjects per group, so there&#39;s a good chance this is simply a false negative or type 2 error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing the limitations in the existing data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300012&quot;&gt;in 2010 I decided to do a meta-analysis on the impacts of set volume on muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  A meta-analysis is a &amp;quot;study of studies.&amp;quot;  This is where you group a body of studies together, and statistically analyze them to see if there&#39;s an overall trend.  In other words, it&#39;s a formal way of seeing where the weight of the evidence lies.  A meta-analysis can be useful when you have a lot of studies with small sample sizes.  The idea is, perhaps each study alone is too small to be able to detect a significant difference between groups, but if you group all the studies together, most of the studies should favor one group over another in terms of the raw average, if there&#39;s truly a difference.  Basically, if a lot of studies have results like the one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski that I mentioned above&lt;/a&gt;, then that&#39;s a pretty good indication that higher volumes truly are better...it&#39;s just that the studies are too small in size to consistently show it (i.e., a type 2 error as I mentioned earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did this analysis, I found that multiple sets per exercise were superior for hypertrophy compared to single sets.  Both categories of 2-3 sets per exercise and 4-6 sets per exercise were greater than 1 set.  The magnitude of the average effect size (again, effect size is a value assessing the meaningfulness of an effect) tended to favor 4-6 sets over 2-3 sets, although that difference was not statistically significant.  Here&#39;s a chart from the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hypertrophy-es.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hypertrophy-es.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there were a number of limitations to this analysis.  First, there were only 8 studies that met my inclusion criteria.  There were only 2 studies that involved 4-6 sets per exercise.  There wasn&#39;t enough data to determine if there were differences due to factors such as training status (i.e., trained versus untrained subjects).  I was the sole author on this paper, so there was no one available to double check my work, and thus it&#39;s always possible some bias or error could sneak in.  This analysis only tells us about volume in a single session, and not overall weekly volume.  Finally, sets per exercise is not the same thing as sets per muscle group.  For example, you could do 1 set of incline press, 1 set of flat press, and 1 set of decline press, and that&#39;s 3 sets for your chest, but in this analysis it would be categorized as 1 set.  Still, more sets per exercise will still mean more sets per muscle group, so this meta-analysis clearly showed that your gains increase as your volume increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Even Better Meta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, more studies on hypertrophy had come out.  Brad Schoenfeld, Dan Ogborn, and I discussed doing an updated meta-analysis, with all of the new research included.  In this analysis, we would have multiple individuals coding the studies to serve as a double-check on accuracy, and help reduce bias.  We would also look at volume in terms of sets per muscle group per week, rather than sets per exercise.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433992&quot;&gt;Our results were published in the June 2017 issue of the Journal of Sports Science&lt;/a&gt;, and we confirmed a relationship between training volume and hypertrophy.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;ll note that since that paper was published, we did discover an error in how volume was classified for a study by Correa and colleagues; we erroneously classified weekly volume as 9 sets in the high volume group and 3 in the low volume group, but it in fact was 18 in the high volume group and 6 in the low volume group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  While this did not materially impact the conclusions of the paper, it did impact the dose-response relationship so that it wasn&#39;t apparent as you moved from &amp;lt;5 sets to 5-9 sets (but it still existed for higher volumes).  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m reporting the fixed numbers to you this review, so they are slightly different from the published paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we found a highly significant effect (with a P value of 0.003...remember that 0.05 is considered significant) for each additional weekly set.  For each additional weekly set that was done, the effect size would increase by 0.027, and the percentage gain in muscle size would increase by 0.38 percentage points.  So, if you did 16 weekly sets (such as 8 sets per muscle group, twice per week) compared to 6 weekly sets (like 3 sets per muscle group, twice per week), the effect size would be higher by 0.27, and the percentage gain would be higher by 3.8 percentage points (such as an 8.8% improvement in muscle size versus a 5% improvement).  Now, this analysis assumes a linear relationship between set volume and hypertrophy, which in real life would likely not be the case.  In other words, this doesn&#39;t mean you can just keep doing more and more sets and assume the gains keep going higher; at some point they will level off and possibly even regress due to overtraining.  Unfortunately we didn&#39;t have enough studies utilizing really high volumes to get an idea where the upper limit for volume might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When categorizing the weekly set volumes into &amp;lt;5, 5-9, and 10+ weekly sets, there was a distinct advantage to double digit weekly set volumes, with nearly double the gains (ES = Effect Size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Impact-of-Weekly-Set-Volume-on-Muscle-Size-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Impact-of-Weekly-Set-Volume-on-Muscle-Size-1-1024x682.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also divided weekly volume into less than 9 sets, or 9+ sets.  Again, the higher volume was better.&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/impact-of-weekly-set-volume-on-muscle-size-9-sets.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/impact-of-weekly-set-volume-on-muscle-size-9-sets-1024x682.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a forest plot of all the studies included in the analysis.  A forest plot tells you whether high volume or low volume was favored in each study.  If a dot is to the right of the center line, it means that study tended to favor high volume.  If it&#39;s to the left, it tended to favor low volume.  The further to the right or left, the stronger the effect.  The size of each dot represents the weight of the study in the analysis; studies with larger sample sizes get more weight.  You can see that nearly all of the studies are to the right of the center line, indicating most studies favored high volume.  Some are dramatically to the right of the line.  In fact, only one study is to the left of the line.  This is consistent with an impact of training volume on hypertrophy.  If there was no impact of volume, then studies would be more randomly distributed around the center line, with some studies to the left, some to the right, and some on the center.  However, this is clearly not the case.  The average across all the studies is represented by the large black diamond at the bottom, which you can see favors higher volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/volume-forest-plot-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/volume-forest-plot-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving Deeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that meta-analysis was published, there is much more existing data on the impacts of set volume on hypertrophy. Let&#39;s do some updated meta-analyses and deeper dives into recent studies and see what we find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems With Previous Meta-Analytic Approaches, and the Inverted U Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous meta-analysis that I published with Brad Schoenfeld, I had classified volumes within each study as &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lower.&amp;quot;  Given there are now a fair number of studies using 3+ different levels of volume in the same study, it&#39;s no longer appropriate to classify volume in such a way.  It&#39;s also not appropriate because, if there is a maximum volume ceiling per training session, then dividing volume this way could mask this effect.  In other words, if I were to use this classification, some studies might show higher volume to be better than lower volume, but others might show higher volume to produce a regression in performance.  When aggregated together, it would suggest there is no benefit to variations in volume.  However, if the latter study used a very high per-session volume that would exceed the theoretical per-session threshold, while the former study did not, it would be misleading to aggregate them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&#39;s say study #1 compares 9 weekly sets to 18 weekly sets, divided into three times per week.  That&#39;s 3 versus 6 sets per session.  Let&#39;s say study #1 shows a benefit to the higher volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study #2 comes along and compares 9 weekly sets to 18 weekly sets, but only trains once per week.  That&#39;s 9 versus 18 sets per session.  Study #2 shows a benefit to the lower volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to aggregate study #1 and study #2 together, they would appear to cancel each other out.  Both compare 9 to 18 weekly sets, but show the opposite results.  However, the two studies utilized different frequencies; it&#39;s very possible that study #1 showed a benefit because the per-session volume was fairly low, and study #2 showed the opposite because the per-session volume became excessive in the highest volume condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the previous approach I had used for meta-analysis (comparing higher versus lower volumes in each study in a binary fashion, or performing a meta-regression while ignoring frequency) is not a good approach.  A better approach is to examine whether there is an interaction between volume and frequency.  If there is, then it would indicate it is better to look at training volume on a per-session basis, rather than a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with my previous approaches is that my statistical models tested for a linear relationship between volume and hypertrophy.  However, this doesn&#39;t effectively test the inverted U hypothesis of training.  The inverted U hypothesis suggests that hypertrophy would decrease if training volumes became excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inverted-u.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to test the inverted U hypothesis with a simple linear function, it would suggest a flat line and no relationship between volume and hypertrophy.  However, this is simply due to the use of the wrong model.  A more appropriate model would be a quadratic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inverted-u-linear-versus-quadratic-1024x760.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also possible that there isn&#39;t really a regression at higher volumes, but more of a plateau or perhaps just slight regression. In this case, an inverted U or quadratic function isn&#39;t appropriate. For example, perhaps our model needs to reflect that there&#39;s a rapid increase in gains as you increase volume in the low end, with diminishing returns in the higher&lt;br&gt;
end. For example, rodent muscle protein synthesis data shows a rapid initial increase followed by diminishing returns and a slight&lt;br&gt;
regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ogasawara.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, a logarithmic relationship is probably the best, or perhaps a logarithmic relationship for early set volume and a flat or slightly declining linear relationship for very high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Technical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what I did.  Now, this section is a bit technical, so you can skip it if you don&#39;t care about methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effect size for each outcome was created by calculating the post-test mean minus the pre-test mean, divided by the pooled pre-test standard deviation.  For example, if there were three levels of volume, then the pre-test standard deviation was pooled across all three levels.  I analyzed the data using what is called &lt;em&gt;robust variance random effects modeling for multilevel data structures&lt;/em&gt;.  This probably sounds like a bunch of statistical gobledygook to you, so I&#39;ll explain it in laymen&#39;s terms.  Basically, when you have a study, you can often have multiple outcomes from the same study (like quadriceps and biceps data).  You have to account for the fact that those outcomes will be correlated, since they&#39;re from the same study (you can&#39;t treat them as independent).  This is where the &amp;quot;multilevel data structures&amp;quot; comes in; my stats help account for this.  Also, a &amp;quot;random effects&amp;quot; model, in laymen&#39;s terms, essentially means that I can&#39;t account for every possible source of variance between different studies, and that the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; effect of volume may vary somewhat randomly (rather than be a single value), so I need to incorporate that uncertainty into my stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, each study is not weighted the same.  Obviously, a study with a larger sample size (and hence more precision) should get more weight in the analysis.  So, each outcome was weighted by the inverse of its variance (i.e., less variance = more precision = more weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike my previous iterations of the analysis, I primarily ran set volume as a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable#Continuous_variable&quot;&gt;continuous variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I took per-session volume and fit linear, quadratic, and logarithmic functions to the data to determine the best fits. Also, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;rest intervals may impact the relationship between volume and hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;, I ran separate analyses for studies using long rests (2+ minutes) and short rests (&amp;lt;2 minutes).  I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-regression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;meta-regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Regression Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With short rest intervals, hypertrophy increased with increasing volume up to 15-16 sets per session, albeit with diminishing returns. This was true for both trained and untrained subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/volume-chart-short-rest-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long rest intervals, a breakpoint model fit the data best, with a combination of a logarithmic curve and a straight line. This model showed hypertrophy to increase up to 6 sets per muscle group, followed by a very gradual regression after that. None of the studies with untrained subjects exceeded 6 sets per muscle group per session, and there were very few data points with less than 6 sets in trained subjects. Thus, I haven&#39;t separated it out by trained and untrained subjects, although an analysis of specifically trained and untrained subjects yielded curves with coefficients (the &amp;quot;multiplier&amp;quot; in an equation or model) similar to the combined data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/volume-chart-long-rest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data would suggest that, with long rest intervals, gains level off or maybe even regress beyond &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an average&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of 6-8 sets per muscle group per training session. I stress average here because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;there&#39;s data showing that individuals may deviate substantially from this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concept of an upper limit of effective volume of around 8 sets in a single training session when using long rest intervals is supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/set-volume-for-muscle-size-the-ultimate-evidence-based-bible/#proteinsynthesis&quot;&gt;the muscle protein synthesis data described earlier in this article, where muscle protein synthesis appeared to plateau somewhere in the 8-12 set range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see how rest intervals impact the upper limits of training volume. With short rest intervals, you have to do approximately twice as many sets per session as with long rest intervals to maximize gains. For a more detailed analysis on this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;check out this Weightology research review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing the Meta-Regression Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this data suggests &lt;strong&gt;a threshold of somewhere around 6-8 sets per muscle group per training session when using long rest intervals. You may have to do approximately double this amount when using short rests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There appears to be an upper limit on of training volume per session, where higher volumes beyond a certain level become &amp;quot;junk volume&amp;quot; and no longer become effective.  &lt;strong&gt;This indicates that the &amp;quot;bro-style&amp;quot; of training each muscle group once per week, blasting each muscle with up to 20 sets per body part or more, may be an inferior way to train&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you&#39;re training above 8 sets per muscle group per session, you may get some benefit of splitting your volume up into more frequent sessions. However, this may vary between individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might think that this contradicts information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;the Frequency Bible&lt;/a&gt;, where there was little difference between training frequencies on a volume-equated basis.  However, the vast majority of studies did not exceed 10 sets per session.  Only two studies involved a frequency where the per-session volume greatly exceeded 10 sets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/High_Resistance_Training_Frequency_Enhances_Muscle.95259.aspx&quot;&gt; Zaroni and colleagues compared 15 sets per session, done once or twice per week, to 3-6 sets per session, done five times per week&lt;/a&gt;.  Hypertrophy was superior in the higher frequency condition.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29528962&quot;&gt;Brigatto and colleagues compared 16 sets per session, done once per week, to 8 sets per session done twice per week&lt;/a&gt;.  Hypertrophy was similar between the conditions.  However, improvements in training load volume were superior in the higher frequency group.  This would suggest that, if the study had been carried out over a longer period of time, that greater hypertrophy may also have followed in the higher frequency condition.  Thus, training frequency likely doesn&#39;t make a difference when the per-session volume is less than around 10 sets.  However, if it greatly exceeds 10 sets, then it may be more beneficial to split the volume into a higher frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also important to note that, in the previous graph, there is a lot of variance.  Within any given set volume, there is a huge range in effect sizes.  For example, with a per-session volume of 6 sets per muscle group, effect sizes range from around 0 to around 1.5.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This demonstrates why one should be wary of drawing too much conclusions from one study when it comes to set volume and hypertrophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; different studies with the same set volumes per session can have widely different results.  This also shows why meta-analysis and meta-regression are so important; it allows you to assess the overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can&#39;t stress enough that these are very rough averages. Just because the average across studies suggests a 6-8 set per muscle group ceiling with long rests, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s true for all individuals. Some individuals may have volume ceilings much higher than this. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;this study that I reviewed in my research review&lt;/a&gt;, some subjects had volume ceilings up into the 30+ weekly set range. They trained twice per week, so some subjects had volume ceilings roughly double the 6-8 set ceiling, even when training with longer rests. However, the averages in that study didn&#39;t show much benefit beyond 20+ weekly sets. &lt;strong&gt;This is why averages can be misleading&lt;/strong&gt;. Averages can be a starting point when it comes to program design, but don&#39;t treat them as a holy grail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume and Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original version of this guide, I used some strength data by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21451937&quot;&gt;Marshall et al&lt;/a&gt;., &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski et al&lt;/a&gt;., and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083231&quot;&gt;Baker et al&lt;/a&gt;. to make some inferences about the dose-response effect of volume on hypertrophy.  I assumed a strong relationship between strength and size gains in trained individuals, and used the strength gains in those studies as a proxy for hypertrophy.  However, as I&#39;ve written in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/progression-for-hypertrophy-your-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;Progression Guide&lt;/a&gt;, the relationship between strength and size is not as close as once thought, even in trained subjects.  In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;in a recent study that I was a co-author on&lt;/a&gt;, there were no differences in 1-RM bench or squat gains between three levels of volume (1, 3, and 5 sets per exercise) in trained subjects.  This is despite the fact that there was a graded dose response in hypertrophy.  There was also no correlation between strength gains and size gains in that study.  The following charts show the strength gains and muscle thickness gains; you can see no difference in 1-RM or endurance gains, but a graded dose response in three out of the four muscle groups tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Volume-Strength-Dose-Response.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact of Volume on 1-RM and Endurance Gains (1, 3, or 5 sets per exercise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dose-response-1024x667.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dose-Response Impact of Volume on Hypertrophy (Sets Per Exercise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strength data cannot be used to make inferences about the impacts of volume on hypertrophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Is Too Much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original version of this guide, I had suggested that an optimal volume lie in the 12-18 weekly set range, and that weekly set volumes of 20+ likely would not result in further gains.  This was based on the following observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the study by &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; on trained subjects, the triceps were subjected to either 7, 14, or 28 weekly sets.  Gains nearly doubled moving from 7 to 14 weekly sets, but there was no further increase with 28 weekly sets.  Also, bench press performance dropped off with that level of volume.  This suggested that perhaps weekly volumes in the high 20&#39;s may be more than necessary.  However, one limitation of this study, which I did not address in the original version of the guide, is that the researchers did not assess bicep gains.  They also did not do anything beyond 12 weekly sets for quadriceps.  Thus, this study is insufficient for determining where an upper limit may lie, as only one muscle group was trained for more than 20 weekly sets.  It&#39;s also important to note that the training frequency for triceps in this study was two times per week.  Thus, the 28 weekly set condition involved 14 sets per session, exceeding the approximate 10-set per session threshold that we established earlier.  Thus, the observed plateau in this study may be due to the frequency.&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ostrowski-triceps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ostrowski-triceps-1024x237.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original guide, I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/research-review-german-volume-training-for-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;the German Volume study that I reviewed in a past research review&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study on trained subjects, 24 weekly sets was not more effective than 14 weekly sets for quadriceps, and 28 weekly sets was not more effective than 18 weekly sets for biceps and triceps.  However, it should be noted that many of these sets were not to failure.  German Volume Training involves doing 10 sets of 10 with 1 minute rest, and you use the same weight for all sets.  The subjects started with 60% 1-RM on most exercises.  In many cases, people can do around 20 reps with 60% 1-RM (this will vary from one person to the next).  This means that early sets were well short of failure; in fact, many of the early sets will fail to accumulate very many &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/quantifying-hypertrophic-reps-and-hypertrophic-volume-load/&quot;&gt;hypertrophic reps&lt;/a&gt;.  Remember that, in this guide, we&#39;re defining volume as the number of &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; sets to failure or near failure.  In this study, the subjects were not doing 14-28 hard sets.  In fact, it&#39;s difficult to ascertain how many hard sets the subjects did.  Also, it likely varied from one person to the next since it was based on % 1-RM, rather than doing sets to a specific Reps In Reserve (RIR).  In other words, one person might be able to do a lot more reps than another person with 60% 1-RM, so their initial sets will be much easier.  Thus, this study is not a reliable data point for determining where an upper limit may lie.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29910312&quot;&gt;The same holds true for another 2018 German Volume Study&lt;/a&gt;; the methodology was nearly identical, and it again is not reliable for determining an upper limit for volume.  It should also be noted that the training frequency was twice per week for upper body, and once per week for lower body in this study.  Thus, the highest volume condition was doing 24 sets per session for lower body, greatly exceeding the theoretical 10-set limit.  This group was doing 14 sets per session for upper body, again exceeding the theoretical 10-set limit.  Thus, the training frequency and per-session volume may also be contributors to the lack of volume effect observed in this study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083231&quot;&gt;a study by Baker and colleagues that examined strength, not hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study, 36-45 weekly sets did not improve strength over 12-15 weekly sets in trained subjects.  However, gains in strength may not be a good proxy for hypertrophy, even in trained subjects.  This might be particularly true in a study like this, where the cumulative fatigue from the very high training volume (36-45 weekly sets) might mask any hypertrophy-related strength gains.  Thus, this study may not be a reliable data point for determining an upper limit for set volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a study performed was performed on high volume training by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2018.00084/full&quot;&gt;Haun and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.  Training lasted for 6 weeks.  Subjects started 10 sets per exercise per week (split into three sessions per week), with approximately one compound exercise per muscle group (squat, bench press or overhead press, SLDL and lat pull).  Subjects did 10 reps per set at approximately 60% 1-RM; the average Reps In Reserve (RIR) was around 4.  Set volume was progressed each week, so that subjects were doing 32 sets by week 6.  Lean mass (assessed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-6-dexa/&quot;&gt;DEXA&lt;/a&gt;) significantly increased by 2.2 kg by the end of the study.  The researchers used bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) to estimate the amount of intracellular vs. extracellular fluid, and subtracted the extracellular fluid amount from the DEXA lean mass to estimate how much tissue gain was &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; tissue gain, versus extracellular water (which might be considered edema or swelling from the high training volume).  The researchers found that, while lean mass continued to increase with progressively higher volume, there was no longer a significant increase in lean mass from the midpoint of the study to the end when the results were corrected for extracellular water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Huan-volume.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study has been used as evidence to indicate anything beyond 20 weekly sets isn&#39;t effective for hypertrophy.  However, there are a number of problems with this conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes in ultrasound-derived muscle thickness (a direct measurement of hypertrophy) were less than 1 mm and were not statistically significant, suggesting that there was very little hypertrophy that occurred in terms of muscle thickness in the muscle groups assessed via ultrasound (vastus lateralis and biceps).  Average muscle fiber area also did not significantly change.  This brings up whether the DEXA data reflects &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; hypertrophy in any way.  Now, this doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t any true hypertrophy in this study.  The increases in DEXA derived lean mass were fairly large.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562558/&quot;&gt;You can sometimes get increases in muscle size, assessed via cross-sectional area, without a corresponding increase in muscle thickness&lt;/a&gt;, as measurements of muscle thickness are done at a very specific point in the muscle.  It&#39;s possible that this happened in this study.  The increase in lean mass via DEXA was not statistically significant, although it did heavily favor an increase (the confidence interval ranged from -0.97 to 5.35).  The BIS data showed an increase in total body water.  This suggests the increase in DEXA lean mass was associated with an increase in body water, which is not always reflective of actual muscle tissue gain (although keep in mind that muscle itself contains mostly water, so this doesn&#39;t rule out muscle growth as a factor).  Overall body mass tended to go in the same direction as the DEXA lean mass data, although not statistically significant.  There are a number of possibilities for this study.  There could have been an increase in muscle size that wasn&#39;t adequately captured by the muscle biopsy or thickness data.  Another possibility is that the subjects may have been slightly overfeeding.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22215165&quot;&gt;Overfeeding alone can increase lean mass in the absence of training, although it also usually accompanied by fat gain&lt;/a&gt;.  It is possible that, if the subjects were slightly overfeeding, it was enough to impact lean mass without significantly impacting body fat, especially given that the subjects were training.  However, such an increase in lean mass would not be &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; muscle, and rather simply an increase in body water.  A third possibility is fluid accumulation that is not related to increases in muscle tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weights were 60% 1-RM, which can be as far as 10 reps away from failure depending upon the individual.  The average RIR for all sets was around 4; in some cases it came near 5.  Remember that this is the average, meaning that some sets were performed with a much higher RIR while others were performed with less.  It should also be noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933716&quot;&gt;the accuracy of RIR tends to fall off the further away you get from failure&lt;/a&gt;.  Thus, subjects were training fairly well short of failure for a number of sets, and thus some sets don&#39;t fall into the &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; sets category.  There may have also been errors in their estimates for RIR.  This makes it difficult to know the number of &amp;quot;hard sets&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of BIS to estimate changes in ECW and ICW in healthy individuals, specifically as a marker of edema in muscle, has not been validated.  In fact, there is no data to indicate that subtracting the BIS-derived ECW from the lean mass in DEXA is valid for distinguishing muscle edema from other types of lean mass changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note is that upper limits on training volume will also depend upon the individual. While there may be, &lt;strong&gt;on average&lt;/strong&gt;, an upper limit of around 6-8 sets per session or 12-24 weekly sets when using long rests, individuals may differ substantially from the average. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;In this study that I reviewed in my Research Review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;some individuals had benefits of 15+ sets per session or 30+ weekly sets, even with long rests&lt;/strong&gt;. This was despite the average not showing much benefit beyond 20+ weekly sets. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;averages are only a very rough guide for programming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Volume Training: Dose-Response Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take a closer look at the dose-response studies that involved very high weekly set volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;by Raedelli and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers compared 1 set, 3 sets, and 5 sets per exercise, done three times per week.  Sets were performed for 8-12 reps to failure, with 1.5 - 2 minutes rest.  The subjects performed bench press, leg press, lat pull down, leg extension, shoulder press, leg curl, biceps curl, crunch, and triceps extension.  If you count the pushing movements towards tricep volume, and the pulling movements towards bicep volume, the total weekly volume for each muscle group was 9, 27, and 45 for triceps, and 6, 18, and 30 for biceps.  The study was carried out over a 6 month period, and was performed on untrained subjects.  It was one of the most well-controlled studies on volume, given that it was performed on Brazilian Navy cadets confined to an aircraft carrier.  Also, it was carried out for 6 months, compared to the usual 6-12 weeks of other studies.  Here are the percentage gains for each muscle group and each volume level:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/radaelli-volume.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/radaelli-volume-1024x576.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a clear dose-response effect in terms of volume in this study, especially in the biceps.  In fact, the gains in muscle thickness observed with 30-45 weekly sets were 3-4 times what is typically seen in studies (most studies show around a 5% increase in muscle thickness).  Now, one odd result of this study was that there was hardly any increase in tricep muscle thickness for a volume of 27 weekly sets.  This is at complete odds with other studies that show significant gains in tricep thickness with much lower volumes in untrained subjects.  The sudden jump to nearly a 21% gain at the highest volume is also very strange.  However, this does not invalidate the study; &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;as I&#39;ve written elsewhere, you can get odd results like this from random chance alone&lt;/a&gt;.  Overall, the study did support an effect of volume, and no plateau was observed for weekly set volumes of more than 20.  It should also be noted that the researchers examined fat-free mass gains.  There were no significant differences between groups in fat-free mass gains; however, this data is likely not reliable since it was assessed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-5-skinfolds/&quot;&gt;skinfolds, which are not a reliable technique for assessing changes in fat-free mass.&lt;/a&gt;  Also, the control group showed a significant increase in fat-free mass; this indicates potential error in the measurements as you would not expect the control group to show an increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;In a study of which I was a coauthor&lt;/a&gt;, Brad Schoenfeld and colleagues replicated the design of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;Radaelli study&lt;/a&gt;, but with trained subjects.  The subjects performed 1, 3, or 5 sets per exercise, for 8-12 reps to failure and 1.5 minute rests.  They trained 3 times per week for 8 weeks.  One difference from Radaelli, other than the length of the study, was that nearly all movements were compound movements (bench press, military press, lat pull, seated row, squat, and leg press; the only isolation movement was leg extension).  Total weekly sets were 6, 18, and 30 for biceps and triceps, and 9, 27, and 45 for quadriceps.  A significant dose-response effect was observed in the biceps, rectus femoris (part of the quadriceps), and vastus lateralis (part of the quadriceps).  There was not a significant effect for triceps, although the overall pattern had similarities to the other muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dose-response-1024x667.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big strength of this study was that it was mostly a replication of another study, and the results were similar.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication&quot;&gt;Replication is an important concept in science&lt;/a&gt;; when independent research groups can replicate results, it gives more credence to the findings.  This study, along with Radaelli, provide evidence that the upper limit for weekly volumes may be higher than previously thought.  You can also see the dramatic variation in how people respond to any given volume.  For example, in the low volume groups, some people had higher gains in muscle thickness than some of the people in the highest volume groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we classify subjects into &amp;quot;low responders&amp;quot; based on whether they met the &amp;quot;smallest worthwhile change&amp;quot; (which is at least 0.2 standard deviation units, or a &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; effect size), then the percentage of low responders decreases as you increase volume.  In fact, there were very few low responders in the highest volume condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/low-responders-1024x682.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same holds true for high responders (define as improving by at least 0.8 standard deviation units, or a &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; effect size).  As volume increased, the percentage of high responders also increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/high-responders-1024x682.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data would suggest that, for people who are &amp;quot;hardgainers&amp;quot;, an increase in volume may be necessary.  This is at odds with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hardgainer.com/&quot;&gt;the conventional wisdom that hardgainers require less volume and more recovery&lt;/a&gt;.  However, this data is in agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP273480&quot;&gt;research on endurance training&lt;/a&gt;, where non-responders do show a response when subjected to more volume.  Now, there are some limitations to this type of analysis.  The percentage of responders could be a totally random phenomenon; if you were to replicate this study, you might end up with no apparent responder/non-responder effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160627&quot;&gt;Heaselgrave and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; explored the impact of 9, 18, or 27 weekly sets on biceps thickness, isometric strength, and 1-RM strength.  Trained males were allocated to a low volume, moderate volume, or high volume group.  The low volume group performed 9 sets targeting the biceps once per week.  The moderate and high volume groups performed 9 or 13-14 sets per session, twice per week.  Exercises were seated supine biceps curl, supine grip bent over row, and supine grip pulldown.  The low and moderate volume groups did 3 sets of each exercise.  The high volume group did 4-5 sets of each exercise.  Subjects performed each set for 10-12 reps, aiming for 2 Reps In Reserve (RIR).  Rest periods were 3 minutes between sets.  There were no significant differences between groups in changes in 1-RM strength or biceps thickness, although isometric strength only improved in the highest volume group.  While there were no significant differences in changes in bicep thickness, the magnitude of the percentage gain tended to favor the moderate group over the other groups (9.5% versus 4.3% or 5.4%).  Judging by the individual data, it appears there were more high responders in the moderate group, as well as less non-responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/heaselgrave-chart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study was that subjects were allowed to train outside of the study.  While the researchers asked the subjects not to do any sort of pulling or bicep movements, and while the subjects did record their own training journals outside the study to ensure this wasn&#39;t happening, it can&#39;t be ruled out that they may have been doing some other pulling or bicep work.  Another limitation is the short duration of the study (6 weeks); it is the shortest study among all the dose-response studies on volume.  It is possible that longer durations could show differences; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414336&quot;&gt;one study found no significant difference in hypertrophy between 12 and 4 weekly sets after 6 weeks, but did  show a difference after 20 weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  A third limitation is that the groups used different frequencies; the low volume group trained biceps once per week, while the other two groups trained biceps twice per week.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;While frequency does not appear to impact hypertrophy much on a volume equated basis&lt;/a&gt;, it may impact hypertrophy when weekly training volumes become high as I pointed out earlier in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; examined the effects of 1, 2, or 4 sets per exercise on hypertrophy in trained subjects.  The study lasted for 10 weeks.  Subjects did 7-12 reps to failure per set, with 3 minute rests between sets.  Each exercise was performed once per week.  Triceps were trained twice per week, as pressing movements were performed on one day, and isolation movements were performed on another day.  Only triceps and quadriceps hypertrophy were assessed.  Quadriceps training volume did not exceed 12 total weekly sets since they were only trained once per week.  However, triceps weekly volume, when counting pressing movements, was 7, 14, and 28 for the low, moderate, and high volume groups, respectively.  There were no significant differences in changes in triceps thickness between the groups, although the percentage gains and effect sizes favored the groups doing 14 and 28 weekly sets.  In fact, percentage gains and effect sizes for 14-28 weekly sets were about twice that of 7 weekly sets.  There was little difference between 14 and 28, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ostrowski-triceps-1024x237.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I no longer consider the Barbalho studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328502454_Evidence_for_an_Upper_Threshold_for_Resistance_Training_Volume_in_Trained_Women&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0914&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) as reliable studies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/15/2/article-p268.xml&quot;&gt;One of the studies has been retracted&lt;/a&gt;. I will have more info on the other one in the future. They are not included in this review or in any of the meta-regression analyses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Progressive_Resistance_Training_Volume__Effects_on.94521.aspx&quot;&gt;Aube and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; looked at the impacts of 12, 18, or 24 weekly sets on hypertrophy in quadriceps of trained subjects. They didn&#39;t find a dose-response relationship. There was no significant differences in hypertrophy between the weekly volumes. For a detailed analysis of this study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/more-volume-or-not-so-many-studies-so-much-confusion/&quot;&gt;check out my research review article on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868813-high-resistance-training-volume-enhances-muscle-thickness-in-resistance-trained-men/?from_term=muscle+hypertrophy&amp;amp;from_sort=date&amp;amp;from_size=10&amp;amp;from_page=2&amp;amp;from_pos=1&quot;&gt;Brigatto and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; looked at the impacts of 16, 24, or 32 weekly sets on hypertrophy in trained subjects. They did see a dose-response relationship, with increasing hypertrophy up to the highest volumes. For a detailed analysis of this study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-january-2020/more-volume-more-muscle-it-may-depend-on-the-training-structure/&quot;&gt;check out my research review article on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are there differences in the outcomes of these dose-response studies?  Three show a benefit to very high weekly volumes (two of which had very similar study designs), while three do not.  There are a number of potential explanations for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random chance&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;As I have written about here&lt;/a&gt;, you can get different results in training volume studies due to random chance alone, even if study designs are identical (which in this case, they are not).  This is especially true when you have small sample sizes (most resistance training studies don&#39;t have more than 9-20 per group), and you&#39;re measuring something that shows tremendous variance from one person to the next, like hypertrophy.  In that article, I did a statistical simulation of 5 different studies that sampled from populations that showed a graded dose-response effect of volume on hypertrophy.  The studies all had different outcomes, as you can see in this set of charts:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sampling-Variance-five-simulated-studies-1024x479.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it&#39;s possible that one factor behind the different results of these studies are due to random chance, or a combination of random chance and different study designs.  This is why meta-analysis and meta-regression become important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short vs. Long Rest Intervals&lt;/strong&gt;.  The three studies showing a graded dose-response relationship up to very high volumes involved short rest intervals of around 90 seconds or less.  The studies that showed a plateau at lower volumes had rest intervals of 2+ minutes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807-longer-interset-rest-periods-enhance-muscle-strength-and-hypertrophy-in-resistance-trained-men/?from_term=Schoenfeld%5Bau%5D+long+rest&amp;amp;from_sort=date&amp;amp;from_pos=3&quot;&gt;Longer rest intervals usually result in more hypertrophy than short rest intervals for the same number of sets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/training-for-hypertrophy-reconciling-the-impacts-of-short-rests-with-drop-sets-and-rest-pause-training/&quot;&gt;This appears to primarily occur with compound movements, and central fatigue may be a mechanism&lt;/a&gt; (although there is debate about this). The use of short rest intervals on compound movements &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/training-for-hypertrophy-reconciling-the-impacts-of-short-rests-with-drop-sets-and-rest-pause-training/&quot;&gt;may inhibit recruitment of high threshold motor units (which have the most capacity for hypertrophy) due to central fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. When you train with short rest intervals, you have to do more sets to make up for this. For a more detailed analysis of this, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-january-2020/more-volume-more-muscle-it-may-depend-on-the-training-structure/&quot;&gt;this research review&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Training Programs&lt;/strong&gt;. The training program a subject is on prior to participating in a study may impact the subject&#39;s response to the study. A subject who has already been training with high volumes may not have the same response as an subject who had been training previously with low volumes. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;the size of the volume jump may impact gains&lt;/a&gt;. Differences among studies may relate to the types of programs subjects were on before embarking on the training, and which groups they were randomized to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that the differences between studies could be due to a combination of some or all of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Your Individual Volume Ceiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guideline of 6-8 hard sets per muscle group per session is based on averages across multiple studies. As I mentioned before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;individual volume ceilings may be substantially higher for some people&lt;/a&gt;. So how do you find your own volume ceiling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method is to use small increments in volume and use progress as a guide when to stop. Start with a low volume of training. When progress stops, increase weekly volume by 20%. For example, if you&#39;re doing 8 weekly sets (4 sets twice per week), increase it to 10 (5 sets twice per week). This should stimulate further progress. Once you hit a plateau, increase weekly volume again by 20%. If an increase in weekly volume of 20% fails to stimulate further progress, try one more 20% jump. If those two successive 20% jumps fail to stimulate further progress, then you&#39;ve likely hit a volume ceiling for that muscle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you&#39;ve hit a volume ceiling and aren&#39;t progressing anymore? Volume cycling might be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Theoretical Case for Volume Cycling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the Schoenfeld volume paper showed an increasing number of responders with increasing volume. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/more-volume-or-not-so-many-studies-so-much-confusion/&quot;&gt;the Aube study showed that the responders were primarily individuals who increased their training volume relative to what they were doing before&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17395765/&quot;&gt;A third study by Bamman et al&lt;/a&gt;. showed that only 16% of the young subjects were non-responders at a volume of 27 weekly sets on quads. All together, this data would suggest that increasing set volume is an effective means to stimulate hypertrophy, especially if someone has reached a plateau and is not responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a limit to how much you can increase volume to achieve further gains. As suggested by the inverted U hypothesis, at some point gains will plateau or regress if volume becomes too high. Thus, at high training volumes, increasing volume is no longer an option once a plateau has been reached. In this situation, dramatically decreasing volume is likely the best option. This would theoretically have the following effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would allow cumulative fatigue to dissipate, resulting in the expression of new strength gains that may have been masked during the cumulative fatigue of the high volume period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would allow for the maintenance of the new size gains, while simultaneously re-sensitizing the muscle to a future volume stimulus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of set volume needed to maintain size is much smaller than the amount of volume needed to increase size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/how-low-can-you-go-the-impact-of-reduced-training-frequency-on-strength-size/&quot;&gt;In a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;, cutting volume from 24 weekly sets (3 times per week) to 8 weekly sets (2 times per week) for 8 weeks resulted in a maintenance of size gains in untrained men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131862&quot;&gt;In this study by Bickel et al.&lt;/a&gt;, untrained subjects did 27 weekly sets to near failure on legs (3 exercises for 3 sets each, 3 times per week).  Training went on for 16 weeks.  This was followed by two different reduced training periods that lasted for 32 weeks.  One group reduced volume by 1/3 (to 9 weekly sets), where training was reduced to only once per week.  The other group reduced volume to 1/9 (3 weekly sets), where frequency was reduced to only once per week and set volume was reduced to one per exercise.  The 1/9 volume condition maintained size in the young but not old subjects.  Muscle size continued to increase in the young, but not old, subjects of the 1/3 volume group for 16 weeks, and then remained steady for another 16 weeks.  Both conditions resulted in a maintenance of strength, if not slight improvement during the reduced volume phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11909878&quot;&gt;In a study on elderly men&lt;/a&gt;, subjects performed 9 weekly sets on legs (3 sets of leg extensions, 3 times per week) for 12 weeks.  This was followed by a 12 week reduced training period where frequency was reduced to once per week (1/3 total weekly volume).  Size and strength were maintained on the reduced volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/rapid-research-rundown-2-16-2017-low-carb-vs-high-carb-detraining-protein-supplementation-and-metabolism-weight-loss/&quot;&gt;In a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;, lean mass was retained during 2 weeks of no training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of re-sensitizing a muscle to training is supported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weightology-weekly-classics/weightology-weekly-classics-muscle-gain/periodic-training-breaks-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;. In that study, subjects who took 3-week breaks from training experienced decreases in muscle size during those 3-week periods. However, when they returned to training, they gained muscle at a faster rate than subjects who had been training continuously until they caught up with those subjects. This indicates that the muscles of the subjects who took time off were sensitized to the training stimulus due to detraining, and experienced rapid regain (also often called &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot;). But what would have happened if, rather than completely taking time off, the subjects simply had done a period of reduced training volume? We don&#39;t know, but we can speculate that perhaps the subjects might have maintained their size, and then when returning to full volume, might have increased at a faster rate than the subjects training at constant volume. However, this is purely speculative, and unfortunately there is no research that has examined this directly. There is at least some theoretical basis for it, though. Once the body adapts to a stimulus, you must provide more stimulus (volume in this case) to continue to produce adaptation. However, you cannot continue to increase the stimulus indefinitely. At some point, you need to make your body more responsive to the stimulus again, and the only way to do that is to reduce (but not eliminate) the stimulus. This will allow for maintenance of adaptations, while allowing the body to recover and become primed for a future increase in the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also possible that gains may continue for a period of time during a reduction in training volume. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131862&quot;&gt;the study by Bickel and colleagues that I mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, subjects continued to gain size when they cut volume from 27 weekly sets to 9 weekly sets (but not 3 weekly sets). Now, this study was on untrained subjects, but it at least raises the possibility of continued gains during the initial periods of volume reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this limited data, we can hypothesize that volume cycling may be beneficial to maximizing hypertrophy over time. Set volume is increased over time until a maximum effective stimulus is achieved. You stay at this volume until performance plateaus, and then dramatically reduce volume for a period of time. You then start the cycle again. This approach is similar to the approach of cycling between minimum effective volume and maximum recoverable volume recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://renaissanceperiodization.com/&quot;&gt;Mike Israetel and Renaissance Periodization&lt;/a&gt;. One primary difference from their method is that you use performance as a gauge as to when to stop a high volume cycle, rather than having a preplanned number of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how a hypothetical cycle might progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with a low training volume (for example, 2-3 sets per muscle group or 4-6 weekly sets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add sets per muscle group or per exercise over time (such as once per week, or per session as long as you don&#39;t experience next-day soreness). &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;Some research suggests a 20% increase in set volume is appropriate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue adding sets until you hit a plateau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If two successive 20% increases in volume fail to stimulate further progress, then you&#39;ve likely hit a plateau. Reduce volume back to near the volume is step 1. You may continue to notice strength improvements during this time as cumulative fatigue dissipates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue training at low volume for a period of time to allow your muscles to re-sensitize themselves to a new volume stimulus. The amount of time will likely depend upon how you feel and how your gym performance is doing. If gym performance starts to regress during the low volume period, increase volume a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step #2 and ramp volume back up again. Continue cycling between periods of low, medium, and high volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative process would be to only increase volume when you hit a plateau as described in the previous section &amp;quot;Finding Your Volume Ceiling.&amp;quot; For example, you stick with low volume until performance is no longer improving. Once you hit a plateau, you increase volume by 20%. You continue to increase volume by 20% for every plateau until two successive volume increases fail to further stimulate progress. Then you go back to low volume and start the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can be used in the context of body part specialization (&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/set-volume-for-muscle-size-the-ultimate-evidence-based-bible/#highexample&quot;&gt;discussed later in this article&lt;/a&gt;). Perform a volume ramp with one or two muscle groups, while keeping all other muscle groups on low volume maintenance. Once the high volume cycle is finished for those one or two muscle groups, return those muscle groups to low volume, and then begin a volume ramp for one or two other muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that this is all speculative and hypothetical. We need more research examining the impacts of varying set volume over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume Cycling Via Alterations in Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing weekly volume by adding training days represents an alternative to adding sets within a training session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, increasing volume by adding frequency would increase gains. Unfortunately, there is very limited research as to the effects of using a higher frequency as a tool to increase volume. One study where this did occur was the study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160627&quot;&gt;Heaselgrave and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; which was discussed earlier. The lowest volume group did 9 sets on biceps, once per week, while the moderate volume group did 9 sets on biceps, twice per week. While not statistically significant, the increase in frequency tended to show an improvement in hypertrophy, with a doubling of the percentage change (9.5 versus 4.3%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/heaselgrave-chart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this was the only study performed on trained subjects. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29852092&quot;&gt;Barcelos and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; compared 3 sets of leg extensions performed 2, 3, or 5 times per week (6, 9, and 15 weekly sets) in untrained subjects. While changes in muscle size tended to be the greatest in the highest weekly volume group after 4 weeks, the other groups caught up so that by the end of 8 weeks, changes in muscle size were similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/different-frequencies-and-volumes-in-beginners-1024x682.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, individual results may vary from the averages..&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289872&quot;&gt;This same study by Barcelos&lt;/a&gt; showed about a third of beginners benefited from an increase in frequency, another third benefited from a decrease in frequency, and a third showed no additional benefit to either one. Thus, with 2/3 of the subjects showing either a benefit or neutral effect of lower frequency, beginners are best erring on the side of low volume and frequency for their hypertrophy programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced individuals, a method of volume cycling using frequency could start off with 5 sets once per week, and then progress to 5 sets twice per week after 6-12 weeks or a plateau is experienced. After another 6-12 weeks or a plateau, frequency is increased again to three times per week (15 weekly sets). A final overreaching phase could then be undertaken with 5 sets performed 4 times per week (20 weekly sets). Then frequency can be reduced back to 1-2 times per week to begin another volume cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Genetics of the Volume Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While volume may be a tool to help turn non-responders into responders, especially in trained subjects, there are still limitations to its ability to induce a response. The evidence suggests that how people respond to volume is genetically determined. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In this study&lt;/a&gt;, beginning lifters performed single leg press and single leg extensions. One leg was trained with low volume (1 set per exercise or 2 total sets for quadriceps), and the other with moderate volume (3 sets per exercise or 6 total sets for quadriceps). Since this was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;within-subject design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, it removes the effect of genetic variability, and allows a scientist to isolate the effect of volume. The response to low volume was correlated to the response with high volume, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 (1 is a perfect correlation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/volume-correlation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, subjects who were good responders to low volume also tended to be good responders to high volume. Subjects who were poor responders to low volume also tended to be poor responders to high volume (even if the response was improved). This suggests that genetics are the ultimate dictator of how much muscle you&#39;ll gain, regardless of your training volume. Some people will grow a lot no matter what type of training they do, and some people won&#39;t grow much no matter what type of training they do. While increasing volume may help with your response, it is unlikely that increasing volume will turn you from a hardgainer into an easy gainer. Rather, it is more likely you&#39;ll just turn into less of a hardgainer. That&#39;s not to say you won&#39;t get improvement from increasing volume if you are a hardgainer. If you look at the above graph, there were certain individuals who had a much better response with more sets (such as one individual who went from a 2% change in muscle size with 2 sets per session to nearly a 10% change in muscle size with 6 sets per session).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same study, the researchers found that the subjects who responded the best to higher volume had a greater accumulation of total RNA in their muscles. This was indicative of greater creation of ribosomes, which serve as the site for protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counting Sets: The Direct Vs. Indirect Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice that, in all of this, a set of direct isolation work (like a biceps curl) is treated as a set count of 1, and indirect work (like a row) is also treated as a set count of 1.  The question is whether counting direct and indirect movements as 1:1 in terms of sets is valid.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s no research to guide us to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; ratio (assuming there is one).  In one study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1653&amp;amp;context=ijes&quot;&gt;it was shown that subjects tended to recover faster from single joint lifts compared to multijoint lifts&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that isolation movements may be less stressful than compound movements and possibly benefit from more volume and frequency.  However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25807025&quot;&gt;other data suggests that recovery from single joint exercise may be slower than multijoint exercise&lt;/a&gt;, which would tend to support the idea that a set of compound movements shouldn&#39;t be counted as &amp;quot;1 set&amp;quot; for muscles like triceps.  Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38034743_Neuromuscular_Activity_During_Bench_Press_Exercise_Performed_With_and_Without_the_Preexhaustion_Method&quot;&gt;muscle activity in supporting muscle groups (like triceps in a bench press) may not be maximal compared to a single joint movement&lt;/a&gt;, which would tend to question the 1:1 counting method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is not clear whether counting direct and indirect volume as 1:1 is the best method.  Nevertheless, there is very little data to suggest any other method, and anything else (like counting each compound movement as a &amp;quot;half set&amp;quot;) is based purely on speculation.  Thus, until the data clearly shows otherwise, it is likely best to use the 1:1 counting method. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336594&quot;&gt;This is the same recommendation put forth in a review paper on this topic by Brad Schoenfeld, Cody Haun, Eric Helms, and others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Practical Limitations of Very High Volumes: A Personal Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if very high volume training may be useful in certain situations, and even if one can tolerate such training, one must consider the practical limitations of trying to train with such volumes, especially in regards to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;the high volume training study performed by Schoenfeld, me, and others&lt;/a&gt;, the average training time per session for the highest volume group was 68 minutes.  The subjects performed 7 exercises, for 5 sets each, for a total of 35 sets per session.  However, it&#39;s important to note that this time frame of 68 minutes may not be realistic when applied to someone training in a regular gym. In a resistance training study, you have research assistants pushing you along, and also helping to get weights set up for you.  There&#39;s also no waiting for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with a real-life gym situation, where you don&#39;t have anyone hurrying you along from one exercise to the next, and no one is setting up your weights for you.  I decided to try an experiment to see how long my training sessions would be, if I tried to do 5 sets per exercise so that I was achieving around 30 weekly sets for most muscle groups.  I started out at 1 set per exercise, and would slowly add sets over a number  of weeks to allow my body to adapt to ever increasing volume, and to help minimize any soreness.  When I got to 5 sets per exercise, I was doing the following in a whole body workout (all sets had 90 seconds rest between them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets hack squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets incline dumbbell press (30 degree incline, neutral grip)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets leg extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets machine flye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets skullcrushers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets machine row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets dumbbell curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session (35 work sets total), including warmups, took me about 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete.  Thus, this is a fairly long workout, longer than what I like to do personally (I don&#39;t like to exceed 90 minutes).  At three times per week, this would be about 6 hours per week of training.  Keep in mind that doesn&#39;t even achieve a full 30 sets per muscle group for all muscle groups.  Back only amounts to 15 weekly sets.  There is no calf work, hamstring work, or direct shoulder work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one difference between my experiment and the Schoenfeld study is that I utilized a number of isolation exercises.  Nevertheless, there is a fairly large difference between my experience and the study.  My own experience is probably more relevant to what would happen in real life, as people generally don&#39;t have others pushing them along or setting up weights for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up the idea that, for most people, achieving very high volumes for most muscle groups is going to be unrealistic, especially if you&#39;re using free weights where it takes time to set up.  Thus, the most realistic way to achieve high volumes is through the use of specialization, focusing on 1-2 muscle groups while training everything else in the low to moderate volume range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tying It All Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, there is something called a &amp;quot;convergence of evidence&amp;quot;, also known as &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience&quot;&gt;consilience&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;  This is where, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be strong even if the conclusion from any one particular piece of evidence is not strong.  In this case, we have lines of evidence from protein synthesis data, anabolic signaling data, satellite cell data, and meta-analytic data, all clustering around a conclusion that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more volume is better for hypertrophy, up to around 6-8 sets per training session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is only if you&#39;re using long rests between sets (2+ minutes). If you&#39;re using shorter rests, then volume needs may be higher. These are average ranges and individual needs may vary substantially from these ranges. Here&#39;s an overview of how all the evidence converges.  You can see how every line of evidence points to a similar conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/set-volume-hypertrophy-conclusions.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a number of limitations to these conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may sound like a broken record here, but this is based on average responses.  &lt;strong&gt;Individual responses to differences in volume can vary from the overall average dramatically, and thus volume needs will vary from one person to the next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be some benefits to cycling volume (similar to the Renaissance Periodization method) and having volume &amp;quot;re-sensitization&amp;quot; periods, but this is speculative and the data is limited at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These results only apply to set volumes involving moderate to high repetition ranges (approximately 8 reps or more) to failure or near failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary based on factors such as age, training status, etc.  Age may be a particularly relevant factor here, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;recovery time may increase with age&lt;/a&gt;.  It should be noted that the studies involving 21+ weekly sets all involved young subjects in their 20&#39;s.  Older individuals may not be able to tolerate such volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary between different muscle groups (such as upper versus lower body), if they need to vary at all.  Currently most of the data suggests there is no benefit, but more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary between different types of exercises (like compound versus isolation, or exercises that load a muscle under stretch versus ones that don&#39;t).  It&#39;s possible that some exercises may need less volume; for example, exercises that load a muscle under stretch (like an overhead dumbbell triceps extension) are more damaging to muscle tissue than exercises that don&#39;t (like a hip thrust), so it might be easier to &amp;quot;overdo&amp;quot; it in terms of volume with the loaded stretch exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly set volumes of 21+ are very high, and are going to be more than many individuals can tolerate or have time for.&lt;/strong&gt;  Remember that significant gains are achieved with low to moderate volumes**.  You must consider the needs of an individual, including schedule, volume tolerance, recovery ability, available time to train, importance of achieving maximal hypertrophy, injury history, etc.**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot be ruled out that individuals training with low to moderate volumes may eventually achieve the same gains as higher volumes, but over a much longer time frame.  However, there is no research examining this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending upon an individual&#39;s available time to train, it may be difficult for someone to achieve 21+ weekly sets for most major muscle groups, even if he/she can tolerate the volume.  In situations like these, it may be best to focus on a couple individual muscle groups, training them with very high volume, and using a maintenance volume on the other muscle groups.  Then, after a period of 2-4 months, switch to emphasizing some different muscle groups.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bryankrahn.com/youre-too-boring-to-build-muscle/&quot;&gt;This is a strategy that has been recommended by Bryan Krahn&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most training studies only last 8-12 weeks.  It&#39;s possible that, if you&#39;re training with 21+ weekly sets for a muscle group, you may not tolerate such volumes for longer periods of time (although the study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;by Raedelli and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; lasted for 6 months and involved weekly volumes of 30-45 sets for the arms).  This is where the needs of the individual have to be considered, including many factors mentioned before (training history, injury history, how close sets are being performed to failure, types of exercises being used, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions in science are always tentative.&lt;/strong&gt;  The conclusions of this review may change as more data is accumulated (this review has already undergone four major revisions as new data has come in!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting to note, anecdotally, that some top trainers in the industry use specialization routines and weekly set volumes of 30-40 to achieve maximum hypertrophy in target muscle groups.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bretcontreras.com/&quot;&gt;Bret Contreras&lt;/a&gt; often programs 30-40 weekly sets for glutes in his clients, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bryankrahn.com/youre-too-boring-to-build-muscle/&quot;&gt;Bryan Krahn has mentioned using specialization and 30-40 weekly sets to maximize hypertrophy in a particular muscle group&lt;/a&gt;.  My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpshealthandfitness.com.au/sharing-gains-program-design-arm-hypertrophy/&quot;&gt;Jacob Schepis also embarked on his own 10-month high volume arm specialization routine&lt;/a&gt;, where biceps and triceps each got about 30 weekly sets (about 15 direct and 15 indirect).  Here is visible evidence of his results (and this is in a well trained individual!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jacob-schepis-hypertrophy-1024x559.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application:  A Moderate Volume Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might you apply this information to structuring a training program for maximizing hypertrophy?  Here&#39;s one example of how you might structure a program that uses the best &amp;quot;bang for your buck&amp;quot; range of 10-20 weekly sets per muscle group.  This particular example is a 4-day upper/lower split; most muscle groups are trained via combination of compound and isolation movements.  Total weekly set volume is 16 for most muscle groups.  Sets per muscle  training session are around 8.  Sets are stopped around 1-2 reps short of failure to allow for better recovery, and repetitions and exercises are varied to help reduce joint stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying a program like this, considering using a volume ramp method. Start with 1-2 sets per exercise. Either on a weekly basis, or as you hit plateaus, add one set per exercise. Continue to do this until you hit 8 sets per muscle group or until you&#39;ve done two successive 20% increases in set volume with no further progress. Once you&#39;ve hit a plateau that you can no longer break through, then consider reducing volume again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Moderate-volume-program-example-1-1024x691.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application: High Volume Arm Specialization Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, upper body is trained three times per week (one day is a dedicated arm day) and lower body twice per week.  Total arm volume is approximately 26 sets for triceps and 32 sets for biceps  (counting both indirect and direct movements).  Other muscle groups are in the 12-18 range.  Sets per training session does not exceed 10 per muscle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arm-specialization-1024x647.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that about does it for the most thorough review on training volume and hypertrophy that you&#39;ll find anywhere.  You can be sure that this will be updated as new research becomes available.  Conclusions in science are always tentative, and based on the best available evidence at the moment.  &lt;strong&gt;In the case of set volume and hypertrophy, more is better up to around 6-8 hard sets per training session with long rests and twice as much with short rests.&lt;/strong&gt; High weekly volumes (20+ weekly sets) give best results when split into frequencies of at least 3 days per week.  Of course, this is based on averages, and individuals may respond very differently to changes in volume compared to the average.  It&#39;s also important to point out that &lt;strong&gt;12-18 weekly sets probably gives you the best bang for your buck in terms of hypertrophy relative to the time investment when hitting each muscle 2-3 days per week&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you&#39;re looking to do some very high volume training, &lt;strong&gt;specialization is the most realistic method of achieving high weekly volumes for a particular muscle group&lt;/strong&gt;.  Also, regardless of how you program volume, &lt;strong&gt;the needs of the individual must be considered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Things I Wish I Knew 8 Years Ago</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/thingsiwishiknew/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/thingsiwishiknew/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I&#39;m at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master&#39;s program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you&#39;ve been lifting for some time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just because your numbers are going up doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re doing the exercise right.&lt;/strong&gt; I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility work is extremely important.&lt;/strong&gt; After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn&#39;t realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don&#39;t know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never underestimate the power of warming up.&lt;/strong&gt; I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world&#39;s difference. Consider the exercises you&#39;ll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound movements really do trump all.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you&#39;ve already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you&#39;ll look even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn&#39;t involve crunches and russian twists&lt;/strong&gt; Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I&#39;ve been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly&#39;s, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body&#39;s ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that&#39;s not what we&#39;re after..but you know what I&#39;m saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kettlebells are AWESOME&lt;/strong&gt; I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that&#39;ll challenge your body in ways that you didn&#39;t think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven&#39;t tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag&lt;/strong&gt; I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it&#39;s way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level&lt;/strong&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I&#39;m going to do, how many times, and how much weight I&#39;ll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you&#39;d probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn your damn anatomy.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you&#39;re essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don&#39;t. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you&#39;ll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbodysmart.com/&quot;&gt;getbodysmart.com&lt;/a&gt; which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.&lt;/strong&gt; I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don&#39;t know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don&#39;t undermine its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing mechanics are important.&lt;/strong&gt; This is one that I&#39;ve really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I&#39;m not talking about the typical &amp;quot;exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I&#39;m talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Film yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There&#39;s a difference between what you feel like you&#39;re doing and what you&#39;re ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you&#39;re wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It&#39;s really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I could think of for now, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I&#39;d lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you&#39;re ignoring or could improve. Much love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/&quot;&gt;r/fitness&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m constantly amazed at the amount of support and passion you guys have for the subject and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#introduction&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone. Hope you are all having a wonderful Christmas season. It is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food. However, I hope everyone has been keeping fit. As usual, I&#39;ve collected a few, very recent studies about fitness, health and nutrition to condense them into easy-to-read summaries for all of you. I hope to create some discussion below! Any tips for writing, presentation, analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;squat&quot;&gt;Squat &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#squat&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk, muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, translation into sports performance and more. The literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as Hartmann et al. (2012) showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats. However, more recently, Rhea et al. (2016) found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping. Thus, Pallarés et al. (2019) sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats, parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind: one repetition maximum, maximum propulsive velocity, jump tests, sprint tests, Wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk. Let’s just quickly go over what some of this means. A full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent. A parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee. A half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a 90deg angle. The outcomes will be explained as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups: full squat, parallel squat, half squat and a control group. The control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play. Training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from 60% to 80% of their one repetition maximum. Participants did 4–5 sets of 4–8 repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets. An interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally (lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance, essentially paying attention to the load lifted), they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough, we have determined the one repetition maximum. This is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here. Using this velocity-based method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional, load-based method (Martínez-Cava et al., 2019). Several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes. They increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats. They had better sprints and jumps as well as better Wingate test results. The wingate test is essentially a test for power (work done over time) on a cycling machine. The parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents. The half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum. The power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased. Jump heights improved slightly however, the sprint times were unchanged. The half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a series of likert scales (ratings of subjective feeling) initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain, stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis (joint degeneration, generally in knees, hips and hands) patients, however, it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders. The half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, unlike the other groups. Deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons. The wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable. The soft-tissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support (Hartmann, Wirth &amp;amp; Klusemann, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like previous studies, there was a degree of specificity that came to light. Groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at. However, the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons. Another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining. This further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: The deeper you go in a squat, the better your outcomes (strength, sprints, power, jumping) and this is likely without an increased risk for injury. (Reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spine-flex-and-back-pain&quot;&gt;Spine flex and back pain &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#spine-flex-and-back-pain&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexion of the lumbar spine (basically the spine segment located in the lower back) has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain. This has led to interventions in occupational health (“proper” biomechanics and use of braces) as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift. However, is the association at hand really as strong as we think? Saraceni et al. (2019) very recently conducted a meta-analysis (pooling studies together) / review on the literature regarding this very question. They specifically aimed to see i) if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii) if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain. In total, they managed to gather 12 studies with a total of 697 participants for analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was deemed to be low, however, there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blood-flow-restriction&quot;&gt;Blood flow restriction &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#blood-flow-restriction&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins. A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimum-effective-training-scheme&quot;&gt;Minimum effective training scheme &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#minimum-effective-training-scheme&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher &amp;amp; Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (&amp;lt;60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calorie-surplus&quot;&gt;Calorie surplus &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#calorie-surplus&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Review of Recent Fitness Studies VI Squats, Foam Rolling &amp; Training to Failure</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/reviewfitnessstudies6/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/reviewfitnessstudies6/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, some of you may remember me for making these kinds of posts awhile back. I have still been reading a lot and I wanted to write up another post for everyone again. As usual, this is solely for educational purposes and I hope to encourage a lot of discussion below. Something cool to note is that all of these papers were published this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short review on training to failure and its implications on muscle hypertrophy (muscle growth) by Schoenfeld &amp;amp; Grgic (2019) was recently published. Training to failure is the method of training where repetitions within a set are done until proper form in the exercise cannot be executed. This practice is actually rather common in training programmes because it is theorized that it accumulates more metabolic stress in the muscles and has higher motor unit recruitment. Metabolic stress and hypertrophy do not have a simple relationship as of now even though it is commonly thought that more metabolic stress would lead to more hypertrophy. Motor unit recruitment is how the body will activate specific motor units in order according to the load the muscles must overcome. A motor unit is defined by the muscle fibers that are stimulated by one motor neuron (a nerve, essentially). According to Henneman’s size principle, fatigue-resistant, small, weaker motor units will be recruited first and if required, larger and stronger motor units will be activated. In the context of failure, load is important because high loads (failure or not) will recruit all motor units immediately which makes the motor unit recruitment benefit of failure, null. It is important to describe what the literature generally compares training to failure against. A common alternative is a technique where the endpoint of a set is where you believe you can only do one or two more repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that studies showing training to failure to be superior have some design issues. For example, Goto, Ishii, Kizuka, Takamatsu (2005) had these results but the group that did not train to failure had inter-repetition rest which does not reflect how people usually train. Normally, you would complete all your repetitions and rest once the entire set is completed. It is possible that without the inter-repetition rest, both groups would have had similar hypertrophy outcomes. There are studies where both methods result in similar hypertrophy amongst participants. Nobrega et al. (2018) had 32 participants perform either high loads or low loads to failure or not to failure in leg extensions. Quadricep cross-sectional area was similar between failure and non-failure conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there clearly is not enough data to infer any solid conclusions regarding training to failure. Regardless, some potential practical implications are the use of frequency and exercise selection for failure. Training to failure can be taxing on the body. Izquierdo et al. (2006) had a group training to failure twice a week for 16 weeks and they had a lower number of hormones like testosterone that would help with muscle growth. Therefore, if failure is in a training programme, it may be wise to limit its use to once a week, once every other week or at the end of a mesocycle (a programme) where you are peaking with volume. Exercise selection may also be important as failure for multi-joint movements such as the bench press or the squat may be more taxing than single-joint movements like a bicep curl or a leg extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to say if training to failure has any benefits over training just shy of failure. Regardless, it can be dangerous if used improperly so its implementation into a training programme must be done carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common response to fatigue from strenuous exercise is to consume water. The body becomes dehydrated over time with intense activity and it is important to rehydrate. However, is it possible that plain water consumption may have an adverse effect on the body during/after exercise? Lau, Kato &amp;amp; Nosaka (2019) recently investigated the effects of water consumption on exercise-associated muscle cramps and how water compares to an oral rehydration solution (Gatorade).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous hypotheses suggested that exercise-associated muscle cramps were related to electrolyte abnormalities (diminished minerals like sodium or potassium during exercise). Unfortunately, amongst several problems, electrolyte abnormalities would not explain such a localised manifestation (a cramp in only one muscle) rather than a systemic one and it would not explain why stretching the muscle provides relief. Modern theory proposes that it is more of a neural disorder where there is an imbalance between the golgi tendon organ and the muscle spindles. The golgi tendon organ is located at both ends of muscles and it serves to prevent over-contraction. Muscle spindles are wrapped around the muscle fibres which perform the opposite (prevents over-stretching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, it would be careless to completely eliminate electrolytes from the equation in regards to exercise-associated muscle cramps. In this study, 10 healthy men drank either water or Gatorade after downhill running in a cross-over fashion (all 10 participants would try both beverages, one beverage one week and another the next week). Blood tests would be done before, immediately after and 80 minutes after the run. To determine the intervention’s effect on cramps, electrical stimulation would be applied to calf until a cramp could be induced otherwise known as the threshold frequency. If the threshold frequency was lower, it would imply that you were more susceptible to cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydration had no effect on cramp susceptibility. Cramp susceptibility increased with water but decreased with Gatorade. Cramp susceptibility actually decreased lower than baseline with Gatorade. This reduced cramp susceptibility is unlikely related to electrolytes because Gatorade did not actually increase electrolytes to a significant extent according to the blood tests. Gatorade did, however, have glucose which may have had an effect on cramp susceptibility. This, along with how long cramp susceptibility is increased with water, should be looked into more scrupulously in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Water intake after exercise may actually lead to a higher chance of having exercise-associated muscle cramps when compared to Gatorade intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squats are a popular lower-body exercise as it increases lower body strength, stimulates lower body hypertrophy and has good translation into the performance of important movements like jumping. There has been some doubt as to what is the optimal range of motion for a squat. Deep squats have been shown to have higher muscle activation but it is not entirely impossible that shallow squats lead to comparable strength/muscle size gains. Kubo, Ikebukuro &amp;amp; Yata (2019) sought out to compare the two squat variations amongst 17 healthy males. The participants were either put into a group that did deep squats (knee angle of around 140 degrees) or a group that did shallow squats (knee angle of around 90 degrees, about parallel). The groups were matched according to baseline characteristics and physical ability. Subjects were physically active but none of them followed any specific training programme within the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire programme lasted 10 weeks with a training frequency of twice a week. Two familiarization sessions were done before the 10 weeks to get used to proper squat form and to determine 1 repetition maxes (maximum load you can squat within one repetition). Each proper training session involved three sets. Participants worked up to 90% of their 1 repetition maximum for 8 repetitions for a few weeks. 5kg would be added to the load if they could complete the 8 repetitions. Outcomes measured were squat 1 repetition maxima and various muscle sizes including all the quadriceps, the hamstring muscles, hip adductors and the gluteus maximus. This study is the first to directly measure glute and hip adductor hypertrophy in response to squats. Muscle size was measured with serial MRI images which is the gold standard for muscle size measurement as it can differentiate between muscles and distinguish muscle, intramuscular fat and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep squat group had greater improvements in the deep squat 1 repetition maximum, around 20% better. However, both groups improved in the shallow squat 1 repetition maximum to a similar degree. Quadricep muscles grew about the same between groups. The rectus femoris did not grow to a significant extent in either group (which is in-line with previous research). This is likely because the rectus femoris muscle is a biarticular muscle (a muscle which crosses two joints). When you ascend in the squat, the rectus femoris will try to contract to help with knee extension but it will also stretch as the hip extends. This leads to the muscle being about the same length throughout the entire movement. The hamstring muscles in both groups grew similarly. The gluteus maximus and the hip adductors hypertrophied (grew) more in the deep squat group although not by much. These results can only be applied to untrained males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; In untrained males, deep squats may lead to better strength gains in the deep squat and may have better hypertrophy outcomes in the gluteus maximus as well as the hip adductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foam rolling is the use of foam cylinders, sticks, bars or various other foam equipment for self-massage either before or after exercise in hopes to improve performance or recovery. It is thought to have effects on the thixotropy of muscles which is just another way of saying that it is able to reduce muscle stiffness. They may also help with myofascial trigger points or “knots” in your muscle but the physiology behind all of this is controversial and is a story for another day. Other potential benefits is that it can reduce muscle soreness and increase blood flow to muscles. Wiewelhove et al. (2019) developed a meta-analysis on the subject to see if foam rolling really works. A meta-analysis is the pooling of several studies together to control sampling variance and to get a better idea of the data at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis was bifurcated into foam rolling before exercise and foam rolling after exercise. Pre-rolling had small effects on sprint performance and flexibility and essentially no effects on strength and jump performance. Post-rolling had small effects on sprint/strength recovery and muscle pain perception. Otherwise, post-rolling had nothing to show for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the data for foam rolling was not impressive, it is possible that foam rolling is still relevant for elite athletes. This is because very small improvements in performance are still valuable if your variation in performance is very narrow. If you are a novice, your performance is likely to be highly variable and minor improvements will not be able to manifest itself in performance. Despite all this, there are a few issues with the meta analysis. Most of the studies vary in design and how they carried out the investigations. This makes pooling the research very difficult and is known as high heterogeneity. Furthermore, since you are not able to blind study participants or investigators to foam rolling interventions, the potential for bias and placebo effects is high. Adverse effects from foam rolling should also be considered even though it is generally considered to be relatively harmless. Some populations with peripheral nerve or artery diseases may be at an increased risk for possible adverse effects from foam rolling but more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Foam rolling is likely not very beneficial for performance or recovery if you’re not an elite athlete. However, it may not hurt to do it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein is an important macronutrient that amongst many processes, facilitates muscle growth and recovery. Having healthy muscles is important for completing every day tasks and this becomes increasingly critical as we age. Sarcopenia is the gradual loss of muscle mass generally associated with aging. This is tough to combat as the anabolic response to protein decreases as we age. That is to say, old people do not respond as well as their younger counterparts to an equal amount of protein. The elderly also tend to have a poor appetite towards high protein foods like meat which is related to chewing being tougher in that demographic and various metabolic issues. Researchers have taken this issue and have proceeded to look down other avenues for protein supplementation with one of these being plant-based proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berrazaga, Micard, Gueugneau &amp;amp; Walrand (2019) compiled a review of plant-based protein sources and how they fare against animal-based protein sources. While this study was more in the scope of older demographics, it is still relevant to younger people especially those who consume more plant-based foods. Animal proteins are generally more digestible. This may be because their protein structure are mainly alpha-helix based instead of beta-sheets (these are just different ways particles within proteins can be organized) which makes it easier for the body’s enzymes to digest. In regards to digestibility, however, heating the plant-based foods can make its proteins more accessible. Another issue with plant-based proteins is that they lack a variety of essential amino acids. An amino acid is the basic building block of proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids and 9 of them are labelled as “essential amino acids”. These are amino acids that cannot be synthesized within the human body and they can only be obtained from food. Some amino acids can even be essential earlier on in life but then become non-essential as our metabolic systems develop with age. Ideally, a protein source would be able to fulfill the requirements for all essential amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When put directly against animal-based proteins, the animal protein tends to have a much higher muscle protein synthesis rate after consumption. Muscle protein synthesis is the building of muscle via protein. This is only measuring an acute response but even in more long-term studies, animal protein still outdoes plant protein. To alleviate these problems, it has been suggested to simply eat more protein. It was found that 60g of wheat protein was as good as 35g of whey protein in the context of muscle protein synthesis. Combining different plant proteins that complement each other in regards to essential amino acid content may be a solution but has yet to be studied. Some plant proteins with genetic mutations can be selectively bred in order to have better quality protein. This strategy has been shown to work in children when measuring growth rates among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based proteins may not be as good as animal-based proteins due to their poor digestibility and lacking essential amino acid content. Some strategies to sidestep these issues show promise but it all needs more research especially in the context of sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;main id=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;site-main&quot; role=&quot;main&quot;&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;post-481&quot; class=&quot;post-481 page type-page status-publish hentry&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an illusion of complexity to gaining weight and building muscle (perpetuated largely by people who want your money) but it is actually very straightforward. Your body requires a certain amount of energy (measured in calories) each day in order to fuel its activities. This is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or TDEE. If your diet supplies fewer calories than your TDEE (a deficit), you will lose weight. If your diet supplies more calories than your TDEE (a surplus), you will gain weight. You’ve probably heard of many different diets out there, and when they work, they all achieve weight gain in the same way – manipulating calorie balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates two points of failure to be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underestimating your TDEE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is very easy to do. Just remember, always, that no TDEE calculation is 100% accurate. Treat them as estimates only and don’t get fixated on what a calculator told you if it conflicts with what you’re seeing on the scale. Calculations of calorie burn during exercise, in particular, tends to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate and inflated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overestimating your calorie consumption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most commonly this happens when people pay inadequate attention to what they’re eating. This ranges from eyeballing portion sizes to simply not tracking calorie consumption at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever it is, the most important fact to remember is that &lt;strong&gt;the scale doesn’t lie&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to maintain or lose weight while eating at a true surplus, it would require your body to break the laws of the universe by making energy vanish into thin air. You can read further in our FAQ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/faq/why-cant-i-gain-weight/&quot;&gt;Why can’t I gain weight?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;Resistance_Training&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Resistance Training&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece of the puzzle is adding resistance training to your life. If you simply start eating more without giving your body a stimulus to build muscle, all you’ll do is get fat. That stimulus is resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of debate on the internet about the most optimal and efficient muscle building routines. The truth lies in the old adage – “Many roads lead to Rome”. Most of the sensible routines you can find out there work well if you commit to them and give them time. r/Fitness has a rich history of progress threads that prove a person can build muscle on just about any proven routine. Even better, “gym bros” everywhere have proven repeatedly that you can run some of the dumbest routines imaginable and still make good progress if you are trying hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it doesn’t matter much&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; routine you follow, it’s still important that you do follow a structured routine. You can read more about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/adding-physical-activity/#The_Importance_of_Having_a_Program&quot;&gt;Importance of Having a Program&lt;/a&gt; section of the Adding Physical Activity page. A list of reliable, good quality routines that r/Fitness users commonly recommend can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/&quot;&gt;Recommended Routines – Strength Training / Muscle Building&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;Protein&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Protein&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to ensure that you eat enough protein each day to fuel the process of building muscle. To maximize the benefit for building muscle, you’ll want to consume at least 160g or 0.8g/lb, whichever is greater. You can read more about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/#Macronutrients&quot;&gt;Macronutrients &lt;/a&gt;section of the Improving Your Diet page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your quest to build muscle, keep in mind that there is nothing special about protein powders or mass gainers. Quite literally, they are nothing more than powdered food. The only advantage the offer over any other protein source is convenience – they’re easy to prepare, transport, store, and consume. That’s it. They are just a potential tool you could use to meet your protein or calorie needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;Step_By_Step_Guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Step By Step Guide&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your “before” measurements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These can be any measurements you want, but should at least include weight and photos of front, back, and side (in underwear is ideal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimate your TDEE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember to treat this as an estimate only, and keep in mind the adage “No plan survives engagement with the enemy”. Expect to have to adjust this number over time. In particular, expect it to be higher as you gain weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a daily calorie goal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The best place to start is by increasing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 1.1-1.2). You will usually want to avoid going above 20% more than your TDEE. Going too far above your TDEE will lead to increased fat gain, and could make it very difficult to eat enough food without discomfort. Muscle builds very slowly, so don’t think that more food always = more muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a daily protein goal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Shoot for a bare minimum of 160g per day of protein, ideally spread across four meals. Up to 0.8g/lb per day has been shown to be beneficial for building muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your calorie and protein consumption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tools such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NutritionData&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are very useful for tracking calories. We also recommend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8EbfzFB0mBrMGJ6V2N5QWNfeTg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3-Suns Adaptive TDEE Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, which will adjust its estimate of your TDEE over time. Track&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; you eat and drink, including additives and toppings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take regular progress measurements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Weight should generally be measured once a day (or at least once a week), preferably unclothed and on an empty stomach. Don’t sweat day-to-day fluctuations – &lt;strong&gt;track the trend over time&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Monthly progress photos may be worth considering. Avoid any handheld or scale based body fat percentage measurements – the bio-electrical impedance method is extremely inaccurate and inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust your diet over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you gain weight, your TDEE will inevitably go up – more mass requires more calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight gain, and you will need to adjust it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be patient and do not expect progress to be fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While you can gain &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pretty quickly, gaining actual muscle is a different story. You should not expect to gain more than ~2 lbs of pure muscle per month. Additionally, you should not expect to start seeing visual changes for at least the first month, and no&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;noticeable&lt;/em&gt; changes for at least the first 2-3 months. Don’t let this discourage you.&lt;br&gt;

		<title>Is fruit juice healthier than whole fruit?</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/juicevsfruits/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/juicevsfruits/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, fruit juice is not healthier than whole fruit in general. Even if the juice is freshly squeezed on the spot, drinking the juice is less healthy than eating the fruit whole. You may be tempted into thinking that since fruit juice comes straight from the fruit, they must be nutritionally equivalent. But such thinking is wrong. There are two main reasons for this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the pulp and skin of the fruit that is left behind is high in dietary fiber. Dietary fiber plays a larger role than just promoting regular bowel movements. When you eat a fruit whole, the dietary fiber in the pulp binds to the natural sugar in the fruit as it travels through your gastrointestinal tract. This binding action makes it harder and take longer for your body to absorb the sugar. As a result, the fruit&#39;s sugar accumulates in your blood at a lower and slower rate if you eat the fruit whole than if you drink straight fruit juice. This process lets your body use the sugar more as a direct energy source. In contrast, drinking straight fruit juice leads to a spike in blood sugar. Sensing that you have more sugar than you need, your body quickly releases insulin, leading to a large amount of the sugar in your blood being converted to fat and glycogen. In this way, the blood sugar spike leads to a blood sugar dip (unless more food is eaten), leaving you hungry again. And being hungry makes you eat more. In this way, drinking pure fruit juice leads to poorer regulation of blood sugar and increased calorie consumption, when compared to eating whole fruits. People who are especially sensitive to blood sugar levels may even suffer headaches, weakness, and irritability after drinking fruit juice, whereas these symptoms do not arise when eating the fruits whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study lead by L. F. Burroughs published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition states, &amp;quot;Healthy volunteers ingested sugar-equivalent meals of oranges and orange juice and of grapes and grape juice. Satiety, assessed by two subjective scoring systems, was greater after whole fruit than after juice and the return of appetite was delayed. With oranges, as previously reported with apples, there was a significantly smaller insulin response to fruit than to juice and less postabsorptive fall in plasma glucose.&amp;quot; Interestingly, a study lead by H. H. Stratton and published in the journal Pediatrics found that, &amp;quot;Among children who were initially either at risk for overweight or overweight, increased fruit juice intake was associated with excess adiposity gain, whereas parental offerings of whole fruits were associated with reduced adiposity gain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the pulp and skin of many fruits tends to be high in vitamins and other nutrients. Extracting just the juice leaves behind much of these nutrients. For instance, oranges are a rich source of flavonoids, but much of the flavonoids are stored in the pulp and not the juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of dietary fiber and other nutrients in the fruit&#39;s skin and pulp therefore makes whole fruit significantly healthier than fruit juice. For instance, a study lead by Qi Sun of the Harvard Medical School and published in the British Medical Journal found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;
	Replacing each three servings/week of fruit juice consumption with the same amount of total or individual whole fruits, the risk of type 2 diabetes in the pooled analysis was 7% (95% confidence interval 4% to 9%) lower for total whole fruits, 33% (24% to 40%) lower for blueberries, 19% (14% to 24%) lower for grapes and raisins, 14% (11% to 18%) lower for apples and pears, 13% (9% to 16%) lower for bananas, and 12% (8% to 17%) lower for grapefruit after adjustment for personal factors, lifestyle, and the modified alternate health eating index score (figure). Additionally, we found that replacing fruit juice with oranges, peaches, plums, and apricots was also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: 18% (8% to 28%) lower for prunes, 11% (5% to 16%) lower for peaches, plums, and apricots, and 8% (4% to 12%) lower for oranges.
	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drinking 100% fruit juice is certainly healthier than drinking soda pop or fruit-flavored beverages with artificial sweeteners, nothing beats drinking a cup of water and eating a whole fruit raw.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How To Make Gains Without A Gym</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/gainswithoutgym/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/gainswithoutgym/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are currently without gym access due to quarantines and lockdowns, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote an article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how to go about maintaining your progress or making gains without gym access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it&#39;s not a &amp;quot;how to set up a home gym&amp;quot; article (if you have the money and space for a home gym, gym closures probably aren&#39;t affecting you much), and it&#39;s not written with the assumption that you&#39;re planning on joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/&quot;&gt;r/bodyweightfitness&lt;/a&gt; and never going to the gym again.  Rather, it&#39;s about strategies you can use to adapt &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; strength or hypertrophy training for a period of time without gym access with minimal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since gyms are so ubiquitous (and affordable, in most places), I think most people just haven&#39;t ever had to think about how they&#39;d train for weeks or months without a gym.  However, you can do some effective training with no equipment or very minimal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; training is pretty easy; push-ups, bodyweight triceps extensions, and handstand push-ups are all good ways to train your pecs, triceps, and delts.  You can progress by increasing reps over time instead of increasing load, or you can progress to increasingly challenging variations of these exercises to increase intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pull&amp;quot; training is a little more challenging with absolutely no equipment, but is quite a bit easier if you have an over-the-doorframe pull-up bar.  Without a pull-up bar, table rows are a great option, and you can add load by loading a backpack with books or other heavy household items.  If there are trees nearby, you can do pull-ups on a tree branch (again, using a backpack for added resistance).  And if you have some large water jugs, you can use them as dumbbells for curls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower body training is more of a challenge.  Bodyweight squats probably come to mind first, but they&#39;re quite easy for people who are already in pretty good shape.  However, strict step-ups (just tapping your heel to the floor, and getting no assistance from your down leg) are WAY more challenging than a lot of people realize, even if you&#39;re just using your body weight as resistance, and are easy to progress since you probably have items of varying heights around your house.  Building toward pistols is also a great challenge.  And if you don&#39;t have knee issues, bodyweight sissy squats can also provide a great challenge to your quads.  For posterior chain training, single-leg glute bridges are surprisingly challenging, especially if performed strictly, and it&#39;s fairly easy to add load via a loaded backpack.  If you have someone or something to anchor your ankles, nordic hamstrings curls are HARD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re willing to make just one purchase, you should seriously consider a set of bands.  It would be impossible to list every exercise you can do with a set of strong resistance bands, because the list would include virtually every exercise you could do with barbells or machines.  Bands also help you add resistance or assistance to virtually all bodyweight exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of programming, progressive overload is still the name of the game.  Instead of just adding more weight to the bar, you may need to be a little more creative.  With bodyweight exercises, you can either increase reps, or increase intensity by building up to more challenging versions of the exercises you&#39;re doing.  You can also increase weight via a loaded backpack for a lot of exercises.  For band exercises, you can either add more bands into the mix, or choke up on bands to increase intensity; you can also just add reps.  In general, as long as you have an objective way to make and measure progress, you should be able to maintain muscle pretty easily, and probably keep building muscle.  In terms of strength, your maxes may be down a bit once you can get back under a bar, but as long as you maintained or built muscle, any strength decrements should simply be due to rusty motor patterns, rather than &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; strength losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you have a good idea of the exercises at your disposal, you shouldn&#39;t need to make any huge changes to a training program.  Just sub out your current exercises for other exercises that accomplish the same basic purpose, probably change the set/rep scheme (for people on strength programs, you&#39;re probably going to be looking at higher rep ranges for the time being), and keep the gains rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#39;s the link to the article again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The meat-and-potatoes of it is the list of exercises at the end that you can do with no equipment or minimal equipment.  Most of them link out to pages or videos demonstrating/explaining each exercise.  Hopefully it&#39;s useful for folks who will be without gym access for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to train while gaining/lose weight, why lean bulking sets you up for failure</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/gainingloseweight/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/gainingloseweight/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Howdy folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some thoughts on nutrition and get some conversation started.  Over the past 11 months, I gained 15lbs of bodyweight in pursuit of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwUjeQZmbr8&quot;&gt;250lb keg press&lt;/a&gt; for a strongman competition that eventually got canceled and then a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d99HoIqJsk8&quot;&gt;axle strict press PR of 266lbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that was done, I gradually cut away bodyfat, until I ended up at about the same bodyfat as the previous year but &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vxlF982.png&quot;&gt;4lbs heavier&lt;/a&gt;.  From the photos, the emphasis on pressing seemed to pay off in terms of shoulder and trap growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did all of the above without ever counting calories or macros, and wanted to share how I go about eating and training to support that.  What I&#39;m about to share below comes from a blogpost I wrote, which may make it seem a bit disjointed, but in respect for the &amp;quot;no self-promotion&amp;quot; rules I&#39;m omitting the link to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAINING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always endeavor to phase in small changes to get results, whether it’s training or nutrition, gaining or losing weight.  So when it comes to gaining, since I’m not counting calories or macros, rather than try to eat more at eat meal, I simply try to eat more MEALS.  You can call them snacks if that makes it easier, but either way, the point is to eat food more often than when you’re maintaining weight.  Typically the first place I add a meal is between breakfast and lunch.  From there, just keep finding places between meals to add food.  Since you’re keeping your 3 meals the same, this makes measuring effectiveness super simple.  If you’re not gaining weight, add another meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this DOES get unsustainable, as you can only add so many meals until you’re just eating all the time, so when that happens, it’s again not a question of eating more OF the food you have at meals (increasing portion sizes), but, instead, adding MORE food TO the meals.  The most immediate place to do this is the pre and post training meals.  I’ll give an example with my post training meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day to day post workout shake is already somewhat elaborate, but that’s because it gives me things to TAKE AWAY when fat loss comes (will discuss later).  But let’s take it for what it is: 1 cup of milk, 2 scoops of protein, 1 scoop of PB fit and some whipped cream.  Now that I want to add weight, instead of putting that in a shaker, I put it in a bowl and I mix it with 1 cup of breakfast cereal.  I’ll eat that until I stop gaining weight with it, at which point I’ll now throw in 1 cup of oatmeal.  Eat that until I don’t gain weight with it, and now I add honey.  Etc etc.  For the pre-workout meal, you can do the exact same thing.  Add some honey toast on top of your cereal and milk, or go super dirty and go for Pop-tarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your meals that you’re already eating, you can start adding to them too as the need arises.  And again: you don’t have to mess with portion sizes at all: just add different foods.  I am a big fan of different meat protein sources in a meal, having a meal of steak and ribs, beef and chicken, pork and turkey, etc etc.  Additionally, this could be a time to introduce some less strict protein/fat sources.  Add cheese or sour cream, add half an avocado, mix some PB fit onto the food, etc etc.  Once again, stupidly simple: we’re not changing portion sizes, we’re adding more food period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAINING FOR GAINING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing to keep in mind with how I eat is that eating is ALWAYS there to support training: not the other way around.  This means, I don’t chase scale weight and I don’t aim to always gain weight each week: I train VERY hard when I want to gain weight, and then I eat the way I described above in order to recover from that training.  This allows for muscular growth, rather than the infamous “dreamer bulk”, where all that was gained is fat.  If you’re not training hard enough to grow and you’re eating like you are, you simply get fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we ensure we’re training hard enough?  When you gain weight, you have to make your body fit the program, whereas when you lose weight you make the program fit your body.  That means that, when we lose weight, we use autoregulation (will discuss specifically in that section), but for weight gain I like programs with fixed percentages, sets and reps.  Specifically programs that have all of that and are TOUGH.  The one I always advocate is Jon Andersen’s Deep Water program, which I have written of extensively in the past, and that I still maintain to this day as the most effective program I’ve ever run.  I’ve also seen it transform other lifters, so I know it’s not a fluke.  The percentage, sets and reps are all fixed on the program, and it’s a total ball buster.  The ONLY way you will get through it is if you eat big enough to recover from the workouts, and when you do that, you gain muscle.  Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 Building the Monolith is another fantastic example.  There are very few AMRAP sets in the program, everything else is fixed, and if you work at the top end of all the assistance work, it’s a brutal program where, once again, you must eat to recover.  Super Squats is yet another fine example of a program where YOU have to change yourself in order to survive the program.  I’ve never run Smolov, but from the people I’ve heard that actually made it all the way through, eating like it was a job was critical to the success of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is: don’t wing it, and don’t run a program that allows you to slack off.  PHUL, PHAT, PPL, etc, are all super popular and yet I see a bunch of kids failing to gain muscle on them, and it’s most likely because there’s too much room to slack off on them if you’re so inclined.  Those will be effective choices to come down from weight gain and maintain, but when you want to gain muscle, you need something where there’s a definite number that MUST be reached and the only way to do it is by eating big enough to recover and get there.  It’s also worth appreciating that the 4 programs I mentioned (DW, BtM, SS and Smolov) all BUILD to something at the end and have fixed lengths, vs something to be run indefinitely.  Having that sort of vector will guide weight gain well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF, for some reason, you’re simply not going to do that, then the approach with diet ALSO works with training: add stuff.  Take your root/base program and add in another day of activity (ideally conditioning, but lifting can also work).  Once you can recover from that, start adding in the “snacks” by getting some exercises BETWEEN your exercises.  This is a great time to bring in super/giant sets if you’re not already doing them, as it allows you to add in more work without adding in a whole bunch of time.  Going with the whole “snacks” thing, I tend to keep these movements on the smaller side, going for assistance work rather than adding in heavy compound work.  And you can keep adding on and on to giant sets.  I was running a 4 movement giant set on my press days of some sort of press, bodyweight dips, DB lateral raises and face pulls.  A lotta small movements will add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do this right, it’s never going to be a question of “am I gaining too much fat”, but “am I not eating enough to recover from my training.”  That’s a GOOD position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN ARGUMENT AGAINST LEAN BULKING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat loss remains the easiest goal to achieve.  For proof of concept, think about how many people brag about losing absurd amounts of weight and contrast that with the amount of people that can brag about building large amounts of muscle. The fact remains that fat is far easier to lose than muscle is to gain.  I’ll discuss the easy way to lose fat when I discuss fat loss in general, but once we embrace this idea, it demonstrates why the goal of lean bulking is pretty goofy.  Endeavoring to remain lean at ALL times is purely some Instagram famous silliness with trainees thinking they need to be photoshoot ready at all times.  The truth is, so long as you don’t let yourself get wildly out of control with fat growth (which, if you use the above, you will not be able to do), getting to “lean enough for the summer” shape takes weeks rather than months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, lean bulking fails because it INHIBITS the trainee from being able to pursue training related goals and, in turn, substantial physical improvement.  As I wrote above: nutrition supports training, not the other way around.  So when trainees try to take on the approach of lean bulking by only having a small caloric surplus, they grant themselves the ability to only train slightly above their normal ability, if at all.  Substantial physical growth comes about as a result of substantial training phases, and without the recovery fuel necessary to pursue these phases, the growth simply isn’t going to happen.  It means that attempts to lean bulk are attempts at mediocrity, POSSIBLY adding some insignificant amount of muscle by training exactly as hard as one had before and adding a handful of calories on top of it.  But you’re also going to most likely add a small amount of fat too with that surplus, especially with such lack of training intensity: you’re just experiencing such small growth on BOTH ends that you’re not observing any real change in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, when one trains hard enough to require a significant surplus to recover, one gets significant results in muscular growth, and can quickly trim away any excess fat before pursuing more growth.  Because, in truth, fat loss phases are like a vacation from weight gain phases, for fat loss is FAR easier.  I’ll explain in that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOSING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have upset a LOT of people with the sentiment I’m about to share, but it’s the honest truth: fat loss is easy.  The reason being is that fat loss is about INactivity.  To GAIN weight, we had to keep doing.  We had to cook all the meals, EAT all the meals, typically clean up after the meals, do a LOT of training, etc etc.  It’s a very busy time.  For fat loss, what we do is…nothing.  It’s true: when you do nothing, you lose fat.  The real word for that is “starve”, but the point remains.  To lose fat, all we have to do is NOT eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you get hungry?  That’s fine: be hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like with weight gain, it’s about phasing things.  You don’t want to just suddenly cut out EVERYTHING you were doing when you were gaining weight, because what the hell are you going to do when weight loss stalls?  Instead, start bringing out the things that you brought in.  I do tend to cut the carbs out of the pre/post training meals first, just because they’re a quick kill and now I’ve greatly reduced carbs.  After that, you can either eliminate extra meals or the extra food at your meals, but either way it remains the same: phase things out AS NEEDED.  If you’re losing weight, keep doing what you’re doing until it doesn’t work, and then try to take away something else.  I keep protein high through the process, and will cut fats before I cut protein.  Look at leaner protein sources as needed and cut out the stuff that has extra junk associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s simply a game of patience at this point.  The weight comes off as long as you’re consistent.  It IS worth noting that, for the first couple of weeks, you’re actually going to look worse than you were when you started.  When you’re at the peak of your weight gain, your muscles are full of glycogen and water and look very full.  When you start cutting that stuff away, your muscles are going to fall flat yet you won’t have lost enough actual weight to see any impact on your midsection of muscular definition, so you’re now just a smaller chubby dude, which is a bad look.  HOWEVER, if you stay the course, that sorts itself out.  Just quit looking at yourself in the mirror so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAINING WHILE LOSING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the section on weight gain, with fat loss, we have to make the training match US.  It’s no secret that food is anabolic and a source of energy, and that when we have a lot of it we can accomplish great things.  HOWEVER, we can STILL do great things in a caloric deficit: we just have to be ready to adapt to the days when our energy is low.  That means that programs that employ some manner of auto-regulation are key here, while those that employ fixed sets and reps based off percentages aren’t going to be idea.  5/3/1 does a fantastic job of accounting for this, either by using anchor programs that allow for AMRAP sets (so it’s up to you on that particular day to determine how hard you push) OR programs wherein you can select your training max at the start based off how you are performing.  Brian Alsruhe’s “Darkhorse Program” has the trainee work up to a max for THAT DAY and then uses that max to determine percentage work.  Westside Barbell for Skinny Bastards, despite the name, is about working up to maxes for the day on both the max effort and repetition effort day.  The advanced program in Deep Water is perfectly suited for this. There are other programs out there like that as well: seek them out and use them intelligently.  The point is, whereas with weight gain we were training to build ourselves up, here we train to express all that strength we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as before with weight gain training, things get taken out during weight loss training.  We have less calories, so we have less recovery, so we can’t do as much.  Conditioning workouts can get reduced in terms of intensity, volume, or frequency.  Assistance exercises can be trimmed away.  Extra training days can vanish, etc.  Wait until you need to reduce training before you do: ride it out for as long as you can, but don’t hold on longer than you should, as  that’s going to cause you to burnout.  Thankfully, fat loss is a quick process, and once you are where you want to be you can either ride that out or immediately transition back to gaining weight again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-points%3A&quot;&gt;Key Points: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-points%3A&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) Drug-free muscular potential is influenced by the size of your frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Strength is a function of neural factors and muscular factors.  Once you’ve hit a point of diminishing returns for the neural factors, your strength potential will be determined by how much muscle you can build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Based on a few simple calculations, you can get a pretty good idea of your muscular and strength potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000023934664_Medium4-1024x622.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rear view of healthy young man with his arms stretched out isola&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think almost every lifter has had this thought: “I used to be able to get bigger and stronger so easily!  But lately the gains have been slowing down dramatically, and I’ve barely made any progress in the past year.  How much bigger and stronger can I reasonably get?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a hard question to answer objectively, but I’m going to try.  This article explains the basics of the models I’m using and makes some rough predictions.  Part 2 refines those predictions and lets you know how you can use that information to make training decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, just a smidgen of background information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much muscle you can gain largely depends on the size of your frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How strong you can get is a product of how much muscle you have, and how proficient you are with the lifts you’re using to demonstrate your strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first and foremost, I’ll discuss the model you can use to predict how much muscle you can put on your frame.  Then, based on that information, I’ll discuss the model you can use to predict how much more strength you can gain, and what proportion of that strength potential comes from neural/technical factors, and what proportion comes from muscular factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound complicated and confusing, but bear with me; it’s really pretty simple conceptually, and you don’t need to worry about all the math behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what%E2%80%99s-my-muscular-potential%3F&quot;&gt;What’s my muscular potential? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what%E2%80%99s-my-muscular-potential%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a variety of ways proposed to predict someone’s muscular potential.  They all give reasonably similar predictions, but there are two that I think are notably better than the others, and only one of them is user-friendly.  I’ll touch on them all so that you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-berkhan%2Fleangains-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leangains.com/2010/12/maximum-muscular-potential.html&quot;&gt;The Berkhan/Leangains Model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-berkhan%2Fleangains-model&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s probably the simplest.  Martin Berkhan (the guy who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leangains.com/&quot;&gt;Leangains.com&lt;/a&gt;) developed this model based on his observations concerning the stage weights of drug-free bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight (kg, in shredded, stage-ready condition) = height in cm – 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert that to fat-free mass, you’d multiply the result by .95 (to account for 5% body fat in stage-ready condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re 160cm (5’3″), you should expect to be about 60kg, with 57kg of lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this calculator to see where you’d fall using this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;fat-free-mass-index&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v26/n7/full/0802037a.html&quot;&gt;Fat Free Mass Index&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#fat-free-mass-index&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI) is probably the most well-researched of these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also relatively simple to calculate:  Fat Free Mass (in kg) divided by height (in meters) squared.  It can then be normalized by adding 6.1x(1.8-height in m) so that height doesn’t throw off the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out your FFMI using this calculator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have gotten the idea that an FFMI of 25 is the maximum possible without drugs, largely based off of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/1995/10000/Fat_Free_Mass_Index_in_Users_and_Nonusers_of.3.aspx&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; by Kouri et Al.  You can see how big you’d be with a normalized FFMI of 25 using this calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study compared the FFMIs of 74 nonusers to those of 83 steroid users.  None of the nonusers (which included some successful drug-free bodybuilders and strength athletes) had an adjusted FFMI over 25, whereas around half of the steroid users did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed?  An FFMI over 25 automatically means someone is on drugs, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kouri’s study also reports the FFMIs of top pre-steroid era bodybuilders who won the Mr. America show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-22-19.54.52.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-09-22 19.54.52&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is possible that some of those people used steroids.  However, to quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3dmusclejourney.com/team-bios/&quot;&gt;Eric Helms&lt;/a&gt;‘ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alanaragonblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Aug-2014-AARR-Eric-Helms-Article.pdf&quot;&gt;fantastic article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With certainty we know the majority of anabolic steroid use in the US lifting community began in the late 50s once superior synthetic steroids were produced. However, we also know top American lifters and bodybuilders experimented with testosterone as of 1954. Finally, we know testosterone use likely began as early as the late 1940s among Soviet lifters, considering the institutionalized use by their weightlifting team at the 1952 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are the confirmed records of when steroid use began. However, just because something was not recorded or corroborated does not mean it couldn’t have occurred. The Mexican hormone industry began producing more affordable testosterone in 1945, coinciding with increased public awareness of testosterone’s potential with the publication of ‘The Male Hormone.’ Thus, depending on the level of skepticism applied, one can view the 1939-1959 Mr. America FFMI’s from two perspectives. The highly skeptical can view only the 1939-1944 winners as being almost certainly drug-free, while the moderately skeptical can view the 1939-1953 winners as being almost certainly drug free…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…If we accept the 1939-1944 winners as natural, the average FFMI is 24.9, with the highest reported at 27.3. Applying moderate skepticism and accepting the 1939-1953 winners as natural, the average FFMI is 25.6, with the highest reported at 28.0. These means are not much different from the 1939-1959 group mean. In fact, the authors analyzed the FFMIs to determine if they were increasing over time. They noted: ‘There was no significant trend towards increased FFMI among the Mr. America winners over a 20-year span from 1939 to 1959 (slope = 0.044 FFMI units/yr; p = 0.44 by regression analysis).’ Thus if drug use was occurring, perhaps it wasn’t frequent or effective enough to significantly affect the aggregate FFMI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study even note that the finding of an FFMI upper limit of 25 should be viewed as preliminary, and they noted several methodological limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The possibility that some of the nonusers in their sample were actually using.  However, in their words, “It is impossible that all of the individuals in this cluster (just below 25) were lying.”  Obviously this wasn’t an issue for the Mr. America winners competing before steroids existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their sample of 74 nonusers, in their words, “Might not have been large enough to exhibit fully the upper limits of muscularity attainable naturally.”  This is a major limitation: A sample size of 74 is great for a study in this field, but certainly not enough to encapsulate the entire range of human potential.  They refer to the FFMIs of the Mr. America winners from 1939-1959, which averaged 25.4, with three people exceeding 27, and one with an FFMI of 28.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that the measured and predicted body fat percentages were off by a bit (which would affect fat free mass estimates, and thus FFMI).  However, they go on to explain that the reasonable error range wouldn’t affect the results in any meaningful way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FFMIs are likely higher for fatter individuals.  Adipose tissue isn’t 100% fat; there’s also some water, connective tissue, organelles, vascular networks, etc.  For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8148928&quot;&gt;leaner people, adipose tissue is about 50% fat by volume, and for fatter people, it’s about 85% fat by volume&lt;/a&gt;.  Interestingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.1310060509/abstract&quot;&gt;highest fat free mass&lt;/a&gt; reported in the literature was from a sumo wrestler.  This wasn’t noted in the study, but dehydrating and glycogen depleting would have the opposite effect, reducing FFMI a bit (by about 2 points or so).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last limitation isn’t overly relevant for our purposes here: The FFMI boost from steroids would likely be different for aerobic athletes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; we get from this study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steroids seemed to give people an average increase of about 3 FFMI points (the average for the 83 steroid users was 24.8, and the average for the 74 nonusers was 21.8).  That corresponds to about 7.5-10kg of lean mass.  Of course, this doesn’t take megadosing into account (top pro bodybuilders today can have FFMIs around 40 – I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; doubt someone will hit an FFMI of 37 without drugs), but it’s likely a useful rule of thumb for most people on reasonable doses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You definitely have to pick the right set of parents to reach an FFMI of 25; however, it’s not a hard ceiling like many people believe.  We know an FFMI of at least 27.3 is achievable without steroids; there was no realistic way Stanko could have been pinning in 1944.  In all likelihood, Delinger (FFMI of 28) was drug-free as well in 1949, but if you want to be super skeptical, you can disregard him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains models have three major drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An FFMI cutoff of 25, or a cutoff of height in cm minus 100 would imply that some highly gifted drug-free athletes were, in fact, on drugs.  Multiple people exceeded those “limits” before steroids even existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cutoff of 25 also &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; “catch” a hefty number of people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on steroids.  In Kouri’s study, about half of the steroid users had FFMIs below 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most relevant drawback for the purposes of this article:  They’re not predictive.  Even IF 25 was a true “limit” for what’s achievable without drugs (though it’s not), that wouldn’t mean that most people could reach 25, or even get particularly close to it.  This is also the drawback of the Berkhan/Leangains model: It predicts what generally gifted people can achieve, not what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains are both useful, but they both have some major drawbacks.  In that case, what are the better options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;muscle-to-bone-ratio&quot;&gt;Muscle to Bone Ratio &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-to-bone-ratio&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the brainchild of anthropometrics researcher Francis Holway.  He’s a big enough hotshot to be quoted in David Epstein’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Performance/dp/161723012X&quot;&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he’s patient enough to put up with my pestering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His idea is that the amount of muscle you can gain is limited by how much bone you have.  To quote &lt;em&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One bookcase that is four inches wider than another will weigh only slightly more. But fill both cases with books and suddenly the little bit of extra width on the broader bookcase translates to a considerable amount of weight. Such is the case with the human skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In measurements of thousands of elite athletes from soccer to weight lifting, judo, rugby, and more, Holway has found that each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms (11 pounds) of muscle. Five-to-one, then, is a general limit of the human muscle bookcase. The limit for women is closer to 4.1 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holway experimented on himself, spending years in heavy weight training with a diet high in protein and supplemented by creatine. But as he closed in on five-to-one, inhaling more steaks and shakes only added fat, not muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has a lot of intuitive appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle and bone are intrinsically linked.  For example: They arise from the same stem cell line, they grow and strengthen in response to very similar hormonal signals in puberty, osteopenia (bone weakening) and sarcopenia (muscle weakening) with age are very closely associated, muscle contractions strengthen bone, there’s evidence that muscle and bone can “talk” directly to each other via paracrine hormones, and muscles even have receptors for hormones that were once thought to affect bone almost exclusively (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990248&quot;&gt;here’s a great review&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to read more about the interactions between muscle and bone).  The exact details of their molecular interactions are still being worked out, but it’s becoming more apparent every day that muscle and bone affect each other at a very basic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion also has empirical support.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/6/1012.long&quot;&gt;size of someone’s frame&lt;/a&gt; correlates with how much fat free mass they have, and it’s been found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8201909&quot;&gt;people who are more solidly-built&lt;/a&gt; prior to starting a training program gain more muscle and strength (assuming pre-training FFM corresponded to frame size in that study – a pretty safe assumption).  Bone mass has also been used as a predictor for meat yield (aka muscle mass) from livestock since the ’30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like an FFMI of 25, however, a muscle:bone ratio above 5:1 doesn’t guarantee someone’s on steroids.  Francis has drug-free athletes in his database with muscle:bone ratios nearing 5.5:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle:bone ratio is a much better indicator of someone’s ability to gain muscle because it doesn’t only consider someone’s height (like FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains model do); bone mass also reflects how wide and thick someone’s frame is.  The guy who walks into the gym for the first time as wide as he is tall likely has more potential to gain muscle than the guy who’s the same height, but looks like a zipper when he turns sideways and sticks out his tongue.  FFMI only takes those two peoples’ heights into account, whereas muscle:bone ratio reflects the sizes of their entire frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Francis has thousands of athletes in his database, it’s less likely that a muscle:bone ratio above 5.5:1 will produce a “false positive” than an FFMI of 25 – indicating someone’s on drugs when they really aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, remember that ~50% of the steroid-users in the Kouri study had FFMIs below 25.  A muscle:bone ratio of 5:1 also produces far fewer “false negatives” for people on drugs, but whose frames are too small to reach an FFMI of 25, even with the assistance of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-38917&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Data from the 1981 World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships (formerly the IFBB Mr. Universe), one of the most prestigious shows for bodybuilders who haven’t won their pro cards yet. It’s highly likely that just about everyone in the contest was on steroids. On the left, an FFMI of 25 “caught” 61% of the participants. On the right, a muscle:bone ratio of 5:1 “caught” 94%.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle:bone ratio sounds great, right?  We could predict your muscular limits based on muscle to bone ratio, with 4:1 for women and 5:1 for men being “general” standards that most people should be able to approach; athletes in sports that don’t require a ton of heavy strength training (like swimmers, divers, etc.) approach those numbers, so most people focusing solely on getting jacked should be able to get pretty close to those figures.  Then we could pad those predictions a little by bumping that limit up to 4.5:1 for very gifted women and 5.5:1 for very gifted men, give you a prediction of muscular potential with a range of just a few kilos, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think again.  Unfortunately, the method for measuring muscle and bone mass required by this model requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCIQFjAAahUKEwjmo_Kcz4zIAhULdD4KHcVoBTs&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsummit.sfu.ca%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Firitems1%2F5139%2Fb14920293.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFW3zUfVV5m2yxXZewBhSbdwoeidw&amp;amp;sig2=keUZ1u5VkredEGOroq4a_g&quot;&gt;22 separate measurements&lt;/a&gt; by a trained anthropometrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t you just get your bone mass measured via DEXA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.  The bone mass reading you get from DEXA is the bone’s “dry weight” – just the mineral content, rather than the entire weight of the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while muscle:bone ratio is promising, and perhaps the best method for predicting your muscular potential, it’s not very user-friendly, and basically impossible to assess on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with one final option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;casey-butt%E2%80%99s-maximum-muscular-potential-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/potential.html&quot;&gt;Casey Butt’s Maximum Muscular Potential Model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#casey-butt%E2%80%99s-maximum-muscular-potential-model&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Butt analyzed a metric crap ton of data from drug-free bodybuilders, relying heavily on data from the pre-steroid era to find a simple way to predict your maximum muscular potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found a very strong relationship between peoples’ wrist circumference, their ankle circumference, and their muscular potential.  I’d strongly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/potential_e-book.html&quot;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; that discusses his methods in much more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/6/1012.long&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; previously linked concerning the correlation between frame size and fat free mass also supports the use of the wrist as a predictor of fat free mass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wrist breadth is potentially the best discriminator of an association between frame size and amounts of fat and muscle, independent of stature. &lt;strong&gt;Broad wrists&lt;/strong&gt; are negatively associated with total body fat and positively associated with fat free mass and vice versa. … in the multiple regression analyses, &lt;strong&gt;wrist breadth&lt;/strong&gt; was significantly and negatively associated with TBF and significantly and positively associated with FFM in both the men and the women after adjustment for stature. This suggests that &lt;strong&gt;wrist breadth&lt;/strong&gt; contributes information regarding the size of the upper appendages that is associated with amounts of fat and lean tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8450591&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that, “The variables which correlated most highly with actual frame size were body mass, &lt;strong&gt;ankle breadth&lt;/strong&gt;, hand length and chest breadth, respectively. These variables were also positively correlated (P &amp;lt; 0.01) with fat-free mass (FFM)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; empirical evidence lending support to Dr. Butt’s predictions based on ankle and wrist measurements.  Incidentally, this matches my own observations.  I’ve been thinking that thick joints were the &lt;a href=&quot;http://complementarytraining.net/interview-with-greg-nuckols/&quot;&gt;best predictor of potential&lt;/a&gt; in powerlifting for a while now, based on my experiences training athletes and meeting a ton of other lifters and meets and seminars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Dr. Butt’s model is &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as good as muscle:bone ratio, but it has the advantage of being &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more user-friendly, and it’s also based on a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of data.  Like muscle:bone ratio, it also has an advantage over FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains model because it takes frame size into account, instead of just height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do to get a reasonably accurate prediction of your muscular potential is measure your wrist circumference (between your hand and the bony protrusions at the side of your wrist, with your hand open) and your ankle circumference at its smallest point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the calculator below, or check out Dr. Butt’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/bodypred.html&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt; if you’d prefer to use pounds and inches instead of centimeters and kilos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that his formulas were based only on men.  However, we can do some back-of-the-napkin math and get a reasonable estimate for women as well.  In Olympic sports, female competitors have about &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cen.12445/abstract&quot;&gt;85% as much lean mass&lt;/a&gt; as their male counterparts, and Francis Holway found that women generally top out at around 4kg of muscle per kilo of bone, versus 5kg for men (20% less muscle relative to their frame size).  Furthermore, since women have more essential fat than men do, they tend to perform the best at around 20% body fat instead of 12%.  So, working with those two assumptions, the calculator above likely still gives women reasonable estimates as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these predictions are by no means perfect (perfectly predicting the end result of a process as multi-factorial as muscle growth based on a handful of simple measurements is, quite frankly, impossible).  Dr. Butt even says that some people will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/plateau.html&quot;&gt;doing very well to reach 95%&lt;/a&gt; of the maximum predicted by his model, and that it IS possible for a rare freak or two to exceed his predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at this point, it’s the best we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-on-to-strength&quot;&gt;Moving on to strength &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#moving-on-to-strength&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got a pretty decent idea about how much muscle you can build, so it’s time to turn our sights to strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, strength is a product of two factors:  muscle size relative to your height, and mastery of the lifts you’re using to demonstrate your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/complete-strength-training-guide/#section2&quot;&gt;Strength being related to muscle mass is obvious&lt;/a&gt;; the more muscle you have, the more strength potential you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding neural factors, there are a few ways your nervous system can help you lift more.  The most obvious is simply technical mastery of the lifts you’re using to demonstrate strength.  Also, with training, not only does your technique improve, but your nervous system gets better at activating your muscles (both recruiting more motor units, and helping those motor units contract and relax faster for greater total force output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-001-0543-7#page-1&quot;&gt;In elite powerlifters&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a very strong relationship between strength and fat free mass per unit of height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these lifters, all of whom were competitive at the national or international level, we can assume they’d attained a high degree of mastery for the squat, bench, and deadlift.  The neural component of strength was, if not maxed out, at least comfortably to the point of diminishing returns, so muscle mass was the main thing that determined how much they could lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.53.30.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.57.24.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.59.47.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
Now, it should be noted that this is data from the 1997 USPF nationals, which allowed bench shirts and squat suits.  However, that’s not a major issue because the gear that existed in the mid-90s didn’t give nearly as large of a performance boost as modern gear does.  The squat and bench would be the only two lifts affected, and, most importantly, the gear used in the ’90s didn’t have a steep learning curve or fundamentally change the lift the way modern gear does; most people would throw on gear for 2-3 weeks before a meet, get a ~10% boost out of it, and go back to training without gear after the meet.  So, for my model, I’m taking that into account by decreasing the slopes of the lines for squat and bench by 10%.
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a really basic calculator based on this data.  The next article will have a few that are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more in-depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, those are the basics.  Based on frame size, we can get a reasonable estimate of how much muscle you can build, and based on how much muscle you have per unit of height, we can get a reasonable estimate of how much you should be able to lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it take to reach your strength potential? And what do the steps to do so look like? I couldn’t find a complete, accessible overview anywhere, so I decided to make it myself. This article will be the anchor for the website. It’s a comprehensive framework, meant to get you caught up and ready to absorb the rest of the information on this site. Be aware that a more nuts-and-bolts guide is coming (how to actually plan out your sets/reps/exercises) as well.  This guide is just meant to give you an overview of the important factors and principles in play. If you have any questions, if you think something is incomplete or confusing, or if you just plain think I messed something up, don’t hesitate to let me know how I can make this guide better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000028266218_Medium.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I’ve been wanting to write for a while, but I’ve been putting it off because, honestly, it’s a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could split it into a series, but I don’t want people to stumble across just the second or third installment and miss the context.  However, be aware up front that it’s probably not one you’ll want to chug through in one sitting. Because of that, you can download it below as a PDF so you can read through it at your leisure, along with spreadsheets laying out multiple example programs showing how you can apply the principles in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will cover what it takes for you to reach your strength potential, and how to do it in the most efficient way possible. It’s not going to dwell on specific topics in a ton of depth; its purpose is to give you an overview of the key factors in your journey from wherever you are now, to your ultimate potential.  Resources addressing more specific topics will be linked, but the purpose of this article is simply to provide you with a comprehensive framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Big muscles (duh).  For anyone who needs more reassuring, this guide goes into way more depth on this subject later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mastery of the lifts you’ll be using to demonstrate strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was the strongest athlete of all time?  Anatoly Pisarenko?  Zydrunas Savickas?  Andrey Malanichev? The fact is, there’s not a definitive way to answer that question because they competed in different sports, and strength is defined by the lifts you use to measure it. There is a very large skill component to mastering a lift: You have to get your muscles to work in a very powerful yet precise manner to lift heavy stuff as effectively and efficiently as possible.  This comes with practice – the more specific, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, practice aimed at mastering the lifts you want to use to express your strength is incredibly important. This guide will mainly be talking about the squat, bench press, and deadlift since I’m a powerlifter, and that’s what I know the most about, though these principles are applicable to any strength sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Healthy Joints/Connective tissue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less wear and tear you have on your body, the more you’ll be able to lift, all other things being equal. Your tendons have to be strong enough to transfer force from your muscles to the bones they’re trying to move.  They have a built-in “strain gauge” called the golgi tendon organ that sends a signal to your spinal cord, back to your muscles, telling them to stop contracting as hard, in an effort to prevent a tendon rupture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerves called mechanoreceptors in your ligaments function similarly.  And as you damage or wear away your joint cartilage, it generally heals slowly or not at all (depending on the joint), and once you’ve worn it away, you’re not getting any more.  Over time, this can lead to osteoarthritis. Acute injuries to these tissues generally take a long time to heal (serious ones, at least), and excessive stress to your tendons over time can lead to inflammation (tendonitis), which can progress to degeneration (tendinosis) if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these generally require quite a bit of time to recover from.  What’s more, it’s not uncommon for a soft tissue injury to turn into a long-term headache and impact your training for a long, long time after the initial injury, as collagen generally repairs itself very slowly and often incompletely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, maximizing results while minimizing injury risk is of utmost importance. Worth noting here:  pain and injury don’t always go hand in hand.  That issue is beyond the scope of this guide, but if you’d like to read more, I’d suggest you&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.painscience.com/articles/pain-is-weird.php&quot;&gt; start here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the biopsychosocial model of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key advantages to being young:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your nervous system is a bit more excitable and works a bit faster, meaning you can reach maximal muscular contraction faster.  This is more important for power-dependent sports (like weightlifting) than maximal force dependent sports (like powerlifting), but it plays a role in all of them.  Also, your nervous system is more plastic when you’re young, meaning you’ll be able to learn and master movements faster (and possibly to a greater absolute degree).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bit more of the protein elastin in your tendons, so they’ll be able to store a bit more elastic energy (giving you a more powerful “bounce” out of the hole at the bottom of a squat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You simply recover from hard training faster.  You have higher testosterone levels, you sleep better and release more total growth hormone at night, and a multitude of other factors that help you be better able to handle high training volumes, recover faster, and progress quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are tremendously huge factors by themselves, but they all play a role.  They all peak in your late teens, but don’t start dropping off in a big way until your 30s (neural drive) to 50s (tendon elasticity); the exception is neural plasticity, which peaks basically the minute you’re born, and drops steadily from there (which is why it’s easier to learn new things as a child).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can hit your competitive peak by your mid-twenties (some people peak sooner, but generally it takes quite a few years of hard training to build the requisite muscle mass), it helps take advantage of these factors.  This is not to say that you can’t get very, very strong if you start later, but there are advantages to getting to your competitive peak as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-constitutes-appropriate-training%3F&quot;&gt;What constitutes appropriate training? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-constitutes-appropriate-training%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an entirely context-dependent question.  There are certain factors that are more or less universal (the training must be specific to your goals, there must be some type of overload applied, etc.), but once you get into the nuts and bolts of program design, there are several factors that determine whether or not a training program will be a good fit for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those factors are specific to the individual.  Their background, strengths and weaknesses, specific leverages, preferences, their current diet, lifestyle, and sleep habits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are some factors that will apply to most individuals in larger groups of people, based on their experience level, assuming their goal is to reach their strength potential (and be as competitive as possible, if that’s your aim) as fast as possible. I want you to keep two things in mind when reading the rest of this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m assuming your primary goal is to get as strong as possible, as fast as possible.  If that doesn’t apply to you, then the rest of what I’m about to say isn’t too relevant for you because it’s not in line with your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BY NO MEANS am I saying this is the only possible way to get strong.  That would be foolhardy.  Simple observation is enough to tell you that there are many roads leading to Rome.  So, if you’re tempted to retort, “so-and-so got so strong and they did it another way,” just know that you’re not going to get any arguments from me.  Also, this means that if you are currently in a certain position and the way you got there differs from the one I recommend, that doesn’t mean you’ve screwed up.  It just means you took a different path to get there, and that’s 100% fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, it’s time to really dive into the meat of this article.  Remember, the four things we need to accomplish to get super strong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastery of the lifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy joints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age/minimizing the time it takes to get there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on your experience level, you can use those four characteristics as your focal points to guide your training.  1 and 2 are where your sweet gainz are made, while 3 and 4 are overarching principles that determine how you train to make those sweet gainz and get from point A (wherever you are now) to point B (the strongest you can possibly be) as fast as possible, as safely as possible. Of course, safety and speed go hand in hand; nothing derails your progress faster than an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each phase of your training will be governed by a simple question: &lt;em&gt;What obstacles standing between me and my end goal are hindering me the most right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question helps give your training clarity.  Until you’re as strong as you can possibly be, there will always be a multitude of areas where you could seek improvement.  Asking what factors are hindering you the most right now keeps you from chasing 1,000 different goals at once (which gets you nowhere), and helps you make progress at the fastest rate possible by focusing you on winning the biggest battles that give you the highest rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For new lifters, those factors are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy-in/habit formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with the movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body/muscular awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readiness to train and recover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For intermediate lifters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscular size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to increase your capacity to train and recover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For advanced lifters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency becoming mastery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering the skill of competing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important factors are &lt;strong&gt;buy-in and habit formation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, neither are sexy, exciting topics, but they’re crucially important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to get anywhere as a lifter, you have to be willing to put in the work for years.  A lot of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be thinking: “I’m ready to do it!  I’m excited to see how far I can get in the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most people who start an exercise program end up quitting within the first year, and I’m sure many of them were just as well-intentioned as you are.  It’s unlikely that your initial excitement is going to get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we could redirect way off-course and talk about motivation, choice architecture, identity formation, and a bunch of other neat stuff that you probably don’t care to hear about too much in an already-long lifting article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, here are the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to buy into the process.&lt;/strong&gt;  This means actually spending time and money investing in your results early on.  Everyone values their time, and we assign value to things roughly based on what we’re willing to spend on them.  If all you “invest” in lifting is $30/month in gym fees, and 2 hours of your week working out, then if you give it up, you haven’t lost much.  It makes it easier to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been putting in an additional hour per day reading about lifting, and forked over some more cash on books and coaching, then it’ll automatically start mattering more to you.  It’s called the “sunk cost fallacy.”  The more you invest in something, the more you’re convinced that it’s an important thing to have or do, because you’re a rational person after all, and rational people wouldn’t spend so much time/money/energy on something that wasn’t important and didn’t matter to them personally.  Put your mental biases to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to find a community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-person is best (either find someone who’s already a lifter to show you the ropes, or convince a friend or two to start lifting with you), but online communities still beat going it alone.Whichever route you go, the keys are accountability and support. If your training partners don’t hold you accountable if you start skipping a bunch of workouts (or if they’re the lazy ones), then they’re no good for you.  If the people you lift with or the online community you find is permeated by negativity, it’s no good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to enjoy your training.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a key piece most people miss.  Sticking with something is all about the things that make you want to continue outweighing the things that make you want to quit (motivation &amp;gt; obstacles).  Motivations can be intrinsic (coming from inside you) or extrinsic (coming from outside factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have some degree of extrinsic motivation when they start lifting (wanting to look better, wanting to lose weight, wanting to feel athletic, etc.), but almost by definition, it’s not very strong.  It wasn’t strong enough to even get your foot in the door until you finally started training, after all.  It’s important, but it’s not what you want to rely on; that’s a big mistake a lot of people make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you can’t rely solely on your extrinsic motivation when you first start lifting, it’s very important that you simply have fun training!  That gives you some more intrinsic motivation (genuinely looking forward to the workouts themselves) to keep you going while lifting becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve noticed, of course, that we usually don’t have any problems finding time to do the things we really like doing, even if we know we probably shouldn’t be doing them (“I should really do something productive, but I’m sure I can watch one more episode.  Damn you, Netflix”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people miss this important fact and get way too hung up on the actual details of programming for new lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re first starting out, you’ll gain muscle and strength doing &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anything; the stimulus is so new, your body is simply going to respond strongly to it, even if it’s not the “optimal” stimulus.  The most important thing is that it’s something you enjoy and can stick with, and that physiologically it’s “good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaches love to moan about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/in-defense-of-program-hoppers-dup-revisited/&quot;&gt;program hoppers&lt;/a&gt;,” and they love talking about how new lifters are shooting themselves in the feet by not following masterful training program to the letter.  What they’re missing is the fact that when training new lifters, enjoyment matters just as much as progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If new lifters (with a higher need for extrinsic motivation) don’t enjoy a program, they won’t stick with it, and if they don’t start seeing the results they’re looking for, they’ll get demotivated and quit.  If a coach fails in either of those dimensions (writing programs that work but that people hate, or writing programs that are fun but that don’t get results), they’ve screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual nuts and bolts of how effective-yet-fun programming looks varies person to person.  Some people enjoy more variety (in exercises, set/rep schemes, etc.) and start dreading workouts that look exactly like the rest of the workouts they’ve been doing for the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people love consistency, are wary of change, and enjoy being able to see steady and measurable improvements workout to workout, comparing their performance in one workout to what they did in the same workout yesterday or last week.  A good program for one new lifter may be a terrible program for another, because what constitutes enjoyable training varies person to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-proficiency&quot;&gt;Developing Proficiency &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#developing-proficiency&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on, the second most important factor is &lt;strong&gt;developing proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; with the movements you’re using to express your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you learn a new motor pattern?  Practice.  Specifically, frequent, purposeful practice.  The more times you do something, and do it the way you’re supposed to, the faster your nervous system will master and store the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The practice must be deep and purposeful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t simply go through the motions.  Practice starts before the set.  Visualize how the set is supposed to look and feel, trying to capture as many details as possible: how the bar will feel on your back or in your hands, how you’ll set up, how it will feel to move the load, etc.  Initially you may not be able to capture too much in your visualization, but this is a skill that will improve over time. As you approach the bar, have one cue in mind.  Don’t try to “think your way through the rep.”  Just focus on one thing that will help your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it improves your performance, stick with that cue until you master it and can move on to another.  If it doesn’t choose another cue.  Be aware of how the reps feel as you’re doing them, but don’t obsess about it; use that awareness in the next step.  After the set, analyze it.  How did it feel?  How did it look (again, take video if possible)?  What could be improved upon, and what cue could help you accomplish that improvement? Repeat that process for each set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply doing the movements helps, but to gain proficiency with the lifts as quickly as possible, practice needs to be deep and purposeful to cement the skills and keep bad habits from developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The weights you’re using should be light enough&lt;/strong&gt; that you’re in control of the load and can focus more on properly performing the movement than on avoiding death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the weights should also be heavy enough that it’s still the same basic movement (a heavy barbell squat is pretty dissimilar to an unloaded bodyweight squat). This generally means using a load between 60-80% of your 1rm.  Of course, if you’re a new lifter, you have no idea what your 1rm is.  So the basic rule of thumb is that you should use something between the heaviest weight that you feel very comfortable and confident with, and about 15% less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should stay a long way away from failure on your sets, at least early on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you have to strain to complete a rep, the more your form will break down, at least until you’ve gained proficiency with the motor pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re doing sets of 5, and the first three are beautiful, flawless reps, the fourth is a little shaky, and the fifth looks distinctly different from the first three.  You’re ingraining the proper motor pattern you want to learn with 60% of your work, and something else with the other 40%.  That makes it take longer to gain proficiency with the proper technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should stay at least 3 reps away from failure (to complete a lift) as a new lifter, and almost always stop your sets before (or, if you push a rep too far, as soon as) your form starts to change at all.  At first, you won’t be entirely sure what that feels like, so it helps to either have training partners watch your technique, or record your sets (with the camera set up directly to your side between knee and hip height for squat, at hip height for DL, and 6-8 above bench height for bench) so you can compare how the lifts felt to how they looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will teach you what it feels like to complete reps with good form, what hard-but-flawless reps feel like (often a lift will feel like you screwed something up, but look great on video), and what messed-up ones feel like.  To get in enough work while avoiding failure and technical breakdown, multiple sets of low reps are your best bet.  The fewer reps you do each set, the less fatigue you’ll develop from your first rep to your last rep, and the shorter the time you need to be locked in and focused on your technique will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally, training each lift 2-4 times per week will give you the best bang for your buck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  Two reasons:  1.) You need enough opportunities to practice the movements.  Practice is key for learning anything new.  2.) You can simply do more! You’d have to really crush yourself to get in as much work on a lift in one day as you could in three fairly challenging days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why cap it at 4?  Quite frankly, for a new lifter, you’re probably not going to benefit from doing much more than that.  You could practice the movements a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; more frequently, but probably not enough to make a tremendous difference. More importantly, muscle protein synthesis stays elevated for new lifters for quite a long time: 36-48 hours is pretty typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more experienced lifters, that’s down to 12-24 hours (or less, depending on how hard the workout is).  So with 2-4 sessions per lift, per week, you’re still spending quite a bit of time actually building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next key factor is developing muscular and kinesthetic awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinesthetic awareness is just a fancy way of saying “knowing where your body is in space.”  Developing this ability helps you do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better understand when the movements you’re doing “feel” right or not.  This feedback helps you make adjustments to perform the movements better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help external cues work better.  External cues are those that focus on the outcome of the movement (i.e. for bench, you may say “throw the bar through the ceiling,” rather than “squeeze your pecs”), and are&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/04/17/external-cues/&quot;&gt; generally more effective for enhancing performance&lt;/a&gt;.  The better you understand how it feels for your body to move through space, the more sense external cues will make, the better you’ll be able to apply them, and the more they’ll help your performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to accomplish this?  I’ve found challenging bodyweight movements to be the most effective in teaching overall body awareness.  Do I have a citation for that?  Absolutely not, because that would be damn near impossible to test.  But of all the people I’ve worked with, those with backgrounds in gymnastics and martial arts almost always learn new movements faster than anyone else, and “get” new external cues the quickest.  I’ve also found that “weird” lifts help build this type of awareness too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions of bodyweight movements that can help (start with the ones you can do): push-ups (working toward single arm pushups), dips, inverted rows, pull-ups, monkey bars, planks, rolling of all sorts, single leg RDLs (weighted or unweighted), lunges and split squats (at a speed you can control), single leg balance drills, single leg hops, L-sits, suitcase carries, waiter’s carries, single arm overhead press, bent press, and single arm overhead squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many more that you could try, but choosing 2-3 from that list per session, done for 2 sets of as many reps as you can manage at a controlled pace (not rushing through the motions) generally does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not saying that you’ll directly make sweet gainz from those exercises unless you load them up and train them more like the barbell lifts, but they help you develop the kinesthetic awareness that will allow you to learn new movements better (attaining a higher end degree of proficiency) and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that this type of training usually doesn’t do as much for someone with a strong background in sports (especially if you are pretty good at them, and have played recently), because sports training usually helps you develop kinesthetic awareness.  The people who usually benefit the most from it are folks who haven’t played any sports in a long time (or ever) and haven’t been challenging their kinesthetic abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;muscular-awareness&quot;&gt;Muscular Awareness &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscular-awareness&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece is muscular awareness.  I hate the phrase “mind muscle connection,” but it’s a common expression that gets the point across.  Building this awareness accomplishes two major things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It helps you identify your weak link in a movement if a particular muscle group isn’t “pulling its weight.”&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t know how it feels when a particular muscle contracts, it’s hard to pick it out as the culprit when a lift doesn’t feel right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes internal cues more effective.&lt;/strong&gt;  Internal cues are ones that refer to what a particular part of your body is doing during a lift (i.e. “squeeze your pecs,” not “throw the bar through the ceiling”). Though internal cues are generally less effective than external cues, they still have their place, especially if you’re working on correcting a weak link in a movement, and you’re trying to re-integrate a muscle group into a movement pattern where it hasn’t been pulling its weight.  If a muscle has been weak and limiting a movement, your body learns how to get more out of other muscles to compensate.  When that weak muscle gets stronger, focusing on it can help get it more involved in the lift again and fine tune that motor pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you accomplish this?  “Bodybuilding”-style isolation movements.  The tool is relatively unimportant.  Barbells, dumbbells, machines, and cables are all totally fine.  The goal isn’t to move the most weight, but rather to feel the target muscle contracting to build that muscular awareness (or “mind muscle connection,” if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the movements to build kinesthetic awareness, the goal isn’t necessarily boatloads of sweet gainz (since compound exercises like squats, presses, deadlifts, rows, pull-ups, etc.,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2015-0109#.VWox1Is-A0o&quot;&gt; do just as good of a job at building muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://asjsm.com/24057.fulltext&quot;&gt; especially in new lifters&lt;/a&gt;), but rather to make it easier to learn the lifts you’re trying to build proficiency in, and to make it easier to assess problems and correct your lifts down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-hard-and-recover&quot;&gt;Train Hard and Recover &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#train-hard-and-recover&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last key factor for new lifters is developing the ability to train hard and recover from training.  This is often termed GPP (general physical preparedness), but most people only think of conditioning when they think of GPP.  Though that’s important, there are a few other factors, so I prefer the more encompassing term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/increasing-work-capacity/&quot;&gt;work capacity&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body composition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high body fat percentage&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/being-strong-is-not-an-excuse-to-be-fat-and-being-fat-is-probably-holding-you-back/&quot;&gt; generally goes hand in hand with poor insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and for every pound of tissue gained, a&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06482.x/abstract&quot;&gt; smaller percentage of it will be muscle, and a greater percentage of it will be fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for that.  Higher body fat levels are generally accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154787/&quot;&gt;lower testosterone and higher estrogen levels in men&lt;/a&gt; (since fat tissue contains the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. It should also be noted that the causality here is bidirectional; with low testosterone, it’s easier to gain fat, and more fat further lowers testosterone); lower insulin sensitivity, especially in muscle, will mean more of the energy you consume is stored in fat tissue, and there’s mounting evidence that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25695947&quot;&gt; can decrease anabolic (muscle-building) signaling and increase catabolic (muscle wasting) signaling in your muscles&lt;/a&gt; (and a&lt;a href=&quot;http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3290&amp;amp;context=etd&quot;&gt; second source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, you’ll respond better to training and recover better from training if you’re leaner.  If you’re a male over 20% bodyfat, or a female over 30% body fat, getting down to the 12-15%/20-25% range will make it easier to train hard, recover well, and build more muscle and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic conditioning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written a pretty in-depth piece on the importance of aerobic conditioning for strength athletes, so rather than rehash that here, I’d encourage you to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/&quot;&gt; check it out&lt;/a&gt;. The degree to which you need to do any dedicated conditioning work varies person to person (some people just naturally have higher aerobic fitness), but a general rule of thumb is that if your resting heart rate is in the high 50s or low 60s and you’re under 200lbs, or it’s in the mid 60s and you’re over 200lbs, you probably have a sufficient aerobic base for powerlifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a topic that is impossible to address in a single paragraph.  I’d highly suggest the book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://renaissanceperiodization.com/shop/the-renaissance-diet/&quot;&gt;The Renaissance Diet&lt;/a&gt;” by my friend Dr. Mike Israetel for an in-depth treatment of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle factors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This primarily means sleep and stress management.  Lack of sleep and increased stress decrease how well you can burn fat, build muscle, and recover from training.  I’ll address this is much more depth at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you work toward the goal of being able to train harder and recover better depends largely on where you’re at right now.  If you’re portly, then you should try to lose fat ASAP, whereas if you’re already lean, you shouldn’t try to lose any weight.  If your nutrition is in line, but your baseline conditioning is poor, then you should work on improving your conditioning.  If your conditioning is good but your sleep habits are atrocious, then you’d benefit most from getting more high quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of reassurance if you’re overweight to start with:  You really don’t need to worry about how losing weight will impact your initial strength/muscular progress.  Though new muscle is most easily added in a caloric surplus, it’s entirely possible to gain muscle and strength while losing fat.  This is especially true for people who are both new to lifting and overweight to begin with.  If you set your calories to lose about 1% of your bodyweight per week, consume enough protein (about .82g/lb, or 1.8g/kg), and train hard, then you should have no issues gaining muscle and strength as you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-does-this-phase-last%3F&quot;&gt;How Long Does This Phase Last? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#how-long-does-this-phase-last%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major mistake new lifters make is sticking with beginner programs for too long.  Your two most important objectives are to buy into the process and make training a habit, and to become proficient with the movements.  The third objective (building kinesthetic and muscular awareness) helps with the second objective, and the fourth (ability to train hard and recover well) sets the stage for future training to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gained proficiency with the lifts, there’s no point in dilly dallying with beginner programs any more.  A lot of people will run a beginner’s program entirely too long until they plateau multiple times and wind up frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the strength gains you make on a beginner’s program come from neurological improvements – your nervous system learning the lifts you’re performing.  When you first start lifting, you may have enough muscle to squat 300lbs already, but you can only squat 135 because your nervous system doesn’t “understand” the lift yet; you haven’t built that proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the span of a few months, you should be able to add weight to the bar at least weekly, and your squat may skyrocket into the 300s.  Your muscle mass may have only increased by 10-20%, but your squat went up to a much greater degree because your nervous system adapts to stressors much faster than your muscles do.  When you hit a wall and your lifts stop going up as quickly, it’s because you’re finally bumping up against the limits of how much you can lift with your current muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue getting stronger, you have to gain more muscle.  And simply put, a beginner training routine optimized for learning the lifts isn’t optimized for gaining a ton of muscle mass.  Hypertrophy training generally involves training with accumulated fatigue because the main driver of muscle growth is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#3&quot;&gt; training volume&lt;/a&gt;, but movements are best learned when your muscles and nervous system are both fairly fresh (another reason volume per session shouldn’t be too high, and sets of your main lifts shouldn’t be pushed close to failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_43290&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-43290&quot; style=&quot;width: 157px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![New Lifter&#39;s Guide](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kv9KLMY-475x1024.png)](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kv9KLMY.png)

&lt;p&gt;When you hit a wall for the first time on a beginner’s program, it’s time to shift training styles.  Otherwise, you can only continue to get stronger as you gain muscle, and you’re stuck with a training routine that’s adequate for gaining muscle, but not optimized for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how long should you be on a beginner’s routine before shifting to an intermediate routine?  It depends on the person.  Simply stick with it until you’re having a hard time adding weight week to week without grinding reps.  That lets you know that the easy strength progress you get from gaining proficiency with the lifts is about to run out, so it’s time for a change.  In general, this may take you anywhere from 2-6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it can happen for different lifts at different times.  Is your bench progress slowing, while your squat and deadlift are still shooting up?  Then change your bench training, but keep training your squat and deadlift the same way until they too are topped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intermediate-training&quot;&gt;Intermediate Training &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#intermediate-training&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re out of low-hanging fruit. You’ve gained proficiency with the lifts, so the easy neurological gains are in your rearview mirror.  Now it’s time to grow. You have two primary goals in this phase of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue increasing your work capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll address these in reverse order.  Everything that applied to the subject of being able to train hard and recover well from the previous section still applies here.  If you’re not lean yet, keep cutting.  If your conditioning is still lacking, keep improving it.  If your sleep and diet are still poor and your stress is still high, then keep working on addressing those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing your work capacity is of utmost importance because, as previously mentioned, training volume is the #1 driver of hypertrophy.  You’ve got to handle high training volume to grow, so you need to be able to recover from that training volume.  On top of appropriate nutrition, adequate sleep, low stress, and favorable body composition, simply increasing your training volume over time will help build that work capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to talk about getting jacked.  Before addressing exactly HOW to get jacked, though, I first need to touch on WHY training to gain muscle mass is so important for strength athletes, since I always get a surprising amount of pushback about this idea. If you’re already on board with the importance of gaining as much muscle as you possibly can, feel free to jump to the section titled “implementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-some-people-lift-more-and-others-lift-less&quot;&gt;Why some people lift more and others lift less &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#why-some-people-lift-more-and-others-lift-less&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, by my count, six factors that largely determine how much weight you can lift right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle fiber types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segment lengths (height, limb lengths, torso length, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motor learning factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation/arousal/fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle origins and insertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-size&quot;&gt;Muscle Size &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-size&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bigger muscle, all other things being equal (and those “other things” are the rest of this section), is a stronger muscle. There’s no way around it; past a point, you simply have to grow. I won’t harp on this one too much more, as I’ll be talking about it in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-fiber-types&quot;&gt;Muscle Fiber Types &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-fiber-types&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get this one out of the way early, because it’s often misunderstood. Most people are under the assumption that you’ll lift more if you have a greater proportion of type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers. However, that belief is based on a misunderstanding of terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I muscle fibers and Type II muscle fibers differ in several major ways. Type I muscle fibers are less fatiguable (making them great for endurance exercise) and take longer to reach maximal force when stimulated. Type II fibers, on the other hand, are more fatiguable but can reach maximal force much faster when stimulated (making them great for power-dependent exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the maximal force production for a given area of Type I fibers is very similar to the maximal force production for a given area of Type II fibers.  Depending on what study or textbook you look at, there may be up to a 10% difference.  However, this difference doesn’t mean much in the real world since all your muscles have a mix of Type I and Type II fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compared someone with 70% Type II fibers to someone with 70% type I fibers (both of whom would be outliers), the difference in maximal force production would only be about 4%. Type II fibers simply reach maximal force output sooner, making them better for &lt;em&gt;power-dependent&lt;/em&gt; activities like sprinting or jumping. Powerlifting, though (contrary to what the name may lead you to believe), is NOT a power-dependent sport. Power output actually peaks around 30-60%1rm and is quite low with maximal loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which means, fiber type distribution doesn’t influence how much you can lift very much at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type II fibers are more responsive to strength training and grow more than Type I fibers do, so fiber type distribution &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; limit long-term strength potential &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt;. However, that’s purely theoretical, because research has shown that elite powerlifters (average squat/deadlift of about 285kg/630lbs, and bench 170kg/375lbs) actually have about the same&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luzimarteixeira.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/tipo-de-fibra03.pdf&quot;&gt; Type I/Type II fiber ratio as untrained people&lt;/a&gt;, which leads you to believe the sport itself didn’t select for people with a fiber ratio skewed toward Type II. So it may be a concern for someone with an unusually high proportion of Type I fibers, but it won’t be for the vast majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Type II fibers reach peak force output faster than Type I fibers, there’s a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; chance that they’ll allow for more speed to be developed off the chest on bench, out of the hole on squat, or off the floor on deadlift, and that speed may help you get max weights through the sticking point of the lift more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that’s a bit of a stretch for both squat and bench because the muscles are already contracting quite hard to control the weight while lowering it; for max loads, all your slow twitch fibers are probably recruited already (since they’re the ones recruited first –&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henneman&#39;s_size_principle&quot;&gt;Henneman’s Size Principle&lt;/a&gt;) before you reverse the weight, so regardless of fiber type breakdown, the additional fibers activated as you reverse the lifts are primarily fast twitch anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 437px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fiber-Types-Powerlifters-Fry-2003.png)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Similar proportions of Type I and Type II (IIa and IIb combined) fibers in pretty strong powerlifters and untrained controls. From Fry et. Al, 2003.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for deadlift, most people are weakest off the floor.  Taking longer to reach maximal force output would mainly just affect how long it took for the bar to break the floor, not the speed of the lift itself.  For someone who is weaker in another part of the movement, being able to develop more speed earlier in the movement may give a small advantage, but not enough to be a tremendously important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I’m only saying fiber type distribution is largely unimportant for powerlifting. For other sports, it certainly matters. More Type I fibers are beneficial for endurance events, and more Type II fibers are beneficial for power-dependent sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;segment-lengths&quot;&gt;Segment Lengths &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#segment-lengths&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been talking about how much &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; a muscle can contract with. Now we’re talking about the &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; required to produce movement at a joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torque takes into account both the force applied and the length of the lever (or moment arm) it’s applied against. Basic application: If you’re sitting on a seesaw and someone much larger is sitting across from you, if you’re both sitting at the end of your respective sides, the other person will be sitting on the ground, and you’ll be way up in the air. If they move closer to the middle (the fulcrum), it can balance out the seesaw, even though they’re larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 329px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/see-saw-fat-guy.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This guy would have to be sitting basically right on top of the fulcrum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s say two people are squatting, and everything is the same about them (same basic technique, same level of training, same amount of muscle mass, etc.) except that one of them has longer femurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that either the moment arm the quads are working against to extend the knees (the distance between the knee and the center of mass – roughly mid-foot), the moment arm the glutes/adductors/hamstrings are working against to extend the hip, or both will be longer for the person with longer femurs. That means that his muscles will have to contract harder (produce more force) to produce the required torque to squat a given weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femur and torso length affect both squats and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/everything-you-think-is-wrong-with-your-deadlift/&quot;&gt; deadlifts&lt;/a&gt; in this manner. Additionally, total height factors in; since the length of basically all segments will be longer, it requires more muscular force to produce the requisite torque to lift any given load. Finally, arm length is important for both deadlift (shortens the ROM, making the lift easier) and bench press (increases the total ROM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, taken as a whole, segment lengths really don’t matter too much for OVERALL powerlifting performance. For starters, you’re probably not as special of a snowflake as you think you are. Although there is some variability in relative segment lengths, it’s usually less than 10% except for extreme outliers (so that guy who squats twice as much as you doesn’t do so because you have long femurs. If yours were the same length, he may squat 1.8x as much as you instead of 2x as much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as height goes, required torque increases with height, but so does overall muscle mass.  The scaling is allometric, not linear, so shorter people still have a bit of an advantage, but it’s taken into account with the&lt;a href=&quot;http://wilkscalculator.com/&quot;&gt; Wilks formula&lt;/a&gt;, which levels the playing field for shorter/lighter lifters and taller/heavier lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the advantage that different segment lengths provide in one lift is abolished by a disadvantage in another. Long femurs may be bad for squatting, but they’re usually good for deadlifting (since long arms and legs tend to go hand in hand). Long arms may be good for deadlifting, but they’re usually bad for benching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, segment lengths do affect performance in each lift a bit, but not as much as people who use them as a crutch would like to believe (usually a difference of less than 10%). Furthermore, a disadvantage in one lift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-origins-and-insertions&quot;&gt;Muscle Origins and Insertions &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-origins-and-insertions&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge factor not many people talk about. Our bodies aren’t actually built very well for lifting heavy things. When you compare humans to comparably sized animals, we tend to be far weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for that is difference in muscle attachments. A muscle that attaches further from a joint is capable of producing more torque at that joint. Our muscles, for the most part, attach very close to the joints they move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 328px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Torque-Wrench.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Grab at point B if you want to actually get the job done. Grab at point A if you’re trying to get a sick forearm pump.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good for allowing large ranges of motion (because a given amount of movement at a joint requires less tissue extensibility), but means that the force (linear) our muscles produce isn’t translated very efficiently into torque (angular) at our joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple illustration. If you grip this wrench at point A, you’ll have to pull a lot harder to turn the bolt than if you were gripping it at point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, humans’ muscles attach in a manner more similar to point A, and other animals’ attach in a manner more similar to point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ll see what I’m talking about, let’s compare the hamstrings of a human and a cat. Look how far down the tibia and fibula the hamstring muscles (marked 17 and 18) of a cat insert, compared to how close to the knee human hamstrings insert. That means that if a human and a cat contract their hamstrings with the same amount of force, the cat will produce WAY more knee flexion torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 770px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cat-Muscles.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Efficient hamstrings insertions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 640px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hamstrings.gif)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Inefficient insertions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have some variability in muscle attachment points, and this variability matters far more than variability in segment lengths, because a small change can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to illustrate: Let’s say you’re comparing hip extension torque for two people doing good mornings with their torsos parallel to the ground. One person’s torso is 10% longer than the other person’s. That means the moment arm (basically the front-to-back distance from the barbell to their hip joint) is 10% longer for the person with a longer torso, so they need to produce 10% more hip extension torque to lift a given load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re comparing two people with the same torso length, but one person’s ischial tuberosity (the origin point for the hamstrings) protrudes an extra inch, or their hamstrings originate a bit further down on the ischial tuberosity – which is entirely within the realm of possibility.  Pelvises come in all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pelves.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the distance between the hip joint and the origin of the hamstrings is about 3 inches on average. That extra inch means they produce ~33% more hip extension torque if their hamstrings contract with the same force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because muscles attach so close to joints (usually not more than 2-4 inches away), small variations can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your pecs insert farther down your humerus, you’re more apt to be a big bencher. If your lats insert farther down your humerus, you’re more apt to be able to do some really heavy weighted pullups. If your patellar tendon inserts a bit farther down your tibia, you’ll probably be able to squat more. You know that guy who can curl a ton without impressive biceps? I’d bet he has biceps that insert farther down his radius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-do-we-do-with-all-this%3F&quot;&gt;So what do we do with all this? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-do-we-do-with-all-this%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look back at each of these factors to see where we should direct our efforts in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origins and insertions&lt;/em&gt;: This may impact what technique will allow you to lift the most weight (another reason why the notion of universal “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2014/09/28/myth-perfect-form/&quot;&gt;perfect form&lt;/a&gt;” is laughable), but you can’t really change them, barring surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motivation/arousal/fatigue&lt;/em&gt;: These are all acute factors. Learning how to mitigate fatigue and manage arousal are good skills to acquire, but they have more to do with how much you can lift &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; rather than long-term strength potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor learning/neuromuscular efficiency&lt;/em&gt;: Proficiency/mastery comes with practice.  The incremental gains in neuromuscular efficiency that come with continued practice after the initial improvements when you start lifting aren’t enough to explain the size of the strength differences between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Segment lengths&lt;/em&gt;: Similar to muscle origins and insertions, these may affect technique to a certain degree, but you’ve got to play the hand you’re dealt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muscle fiber types&lt;/em&gt;: Ditto. Plus, they don’t really matter too much for powerlifting anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muscle size&lt;/em&gt;: Ding ding ding. We have our winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the factors we’ve discussed, muscle size is the only one you’re able to change in a major way in the long run, except for motor learning/neuromuscular efficiency (however, the differences between people in this area are pretty small after the initial rapid progress when you start lifting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I’d just like to point out that training with a focus on gaining mass to dominate at powerlifting is directly supported in the literature.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11990746&quot;&gt; One study&lt;/a&gt; found that in elite level powerlifters, performance in all three lifts was strongly correlated (r=0.8-0.9 for some) to muscle thickness in the prime movers (although bizarrely, it was most strongly correlated to subscapularis thickness in all three lifts, just as an aside).&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25611080&quot;&gt; Another&lt;/a&gt;, hot off the presses, found again that one of the strongest predictors of performance in national-level lifters was muscle mass per unit height. Big is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 960px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-School-Powerlifters.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Some of the top guys in the world today, looking suspiciously swole.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of direct quotes: Brechue and Abe. “The Role of FFM Accumulation and Muscle Architecture in Powerlifting Performance.”  European Journal of Applied Physiology.  (2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of the SQT, BP, and DL was strongly correlated with FFM and FFM relative to standing height (r = 0.86 to 0.95, P &amp;lt; or = 0.001).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovera and Keogh. “The Anthropometric Profile of Powerlifters: Differences as a Function of Bodyweight Class and Competitive Success.” The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness. (2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…more successful powerlifters typically have higher degrees of muscle mass expressed per unit height and/or bone mass but similar segment lengths and segment length ratios to their less successful peers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to reiterate, both studies found that the key issue was muscle mass &lt;em&gt;per unit of height&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that, since you can’t make yourself any taller or shorter, simply gaining more muscle is almost always an advantage. Think of muscle mass as &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; strength. If you gain mass, you may not necessarily be stronger right away (i.e. if you trained with lower weights and lost a bit of technical efficiency with max weights), but you have the potential to be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stay the same size, you have a cap on how strong you can possibly get. When comparing two individuals, the one with more muscle may not necessarily be the stronger one (for all the factors listed above – muscle attachments, segment lengths, technique, etc.), though he probably will be. However, when comparing small you to jacked you, all other things being equal, jacked you will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those other factors (apart from muscle size), particularly segment lengths and muscle attachment points, largely explain why some relatively light people who aren’t overly jacked-looking can still lift huge weights.  It’s not that their smaller muscles contract any harder than yours do; it’s that either they have body segment lengths that are advantageous for a certain lift, requiring less torque to lift a given weight, or they have muscle attachment points that allow them to produce more torque at a joint with the same force of muscle contraction.  There wasn’t any special training that allowed them to lift heavy weights with relatively little mass; most of it simply has to do with how they’re built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the primary goal of intermediate training is to get into the highest weight class possible, as fast as possible, while still being fairly lean (below 15% body fat for men, and below 25% for women) and protecting the joints as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people balk at the idea of moving into higher weight classes, because people lift more in higher weight classes, so they think it will benefit them to get into a lower weight class. However, remember the bit about levers and torque.  If you are taller than someone else, you have to produce more muscular &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; to generate sufficient &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; to lift the same amount of weight.  Being taller than other people in your weight class automatically puts you at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you can get super jacked and be one of the shortest people in your weight class (while staying fairly lean), it puts you at an advantage.  Though you may be more competitive &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; in a lower weight class, it’s probably not where you’ll be most competitive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of my weightlifting friends are fond of saying: “Weight classes are height classes in disguise.” Of course, if you don’t plan on competing and are just trying to get strong for its own sake, it should be obvious that gaining as much muscle as possible is a definite advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#implementation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you have three primary goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get freaking jacked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulate the least amount of joint wear and tear possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain or increase proficiency with the lifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a general outline for how to accomplish that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ramp up your training intensity for the main lifts a bit (doing most of your training with 75-85% of your max, with very little work below 70% and very little above 90% unless peaking for a meet) to continue improving your technique and skill lifting heavy weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include more variation for your main lifts.  This will allow you to push your lifts hard, while avoiding monotony and overuse injuries from sticking with the exact same movements all the time.  Paused squat, front squat, close grip bench, bench from pins, opposite stance deadlifts, deficit deadlifts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep volume for your main lifts low to moderate, and stay at least 1-2 reps shy of failure at all times (avoiding technical failure).  You don’t need a ton of high quality, heavy work to maintain and improve neural factors, but getting the bulk of your training volume from your main lifts will generally beat you up a bit more, and limit how much total training volume you can handle per session and per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the bulk of your training volume from accessory lifts for all major muscle groups, with sets of 6-15 reps, training each muscle/movement 2-3 times per week for&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300012&quot;&gt; 4-6 sets&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326698&quot;&gt;or 40-70 total reps&lt;/a&gt;) per session.  I recommend accessory lifts over lighter sets of squat, bench, and deadlift to cut down on risk of overuse injuries, and to keep training specificity high for the main lifts (since lifting heavy stuff for low reps and lighter stuff for higher reps are different skills, you don’t want to “water down” the motor learning you’re doing your main lifts, unless you’re splitting your training into more distinct phases, as we’ll discuss later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for weight increases and PR attempts for the big lifts on a realistic time scale.  At first, use 4 week training blocks, shooting for small PRs every 4 weeks.  When you aren’t hitting PRs consistently on that time scale any more, transition to 8 week cycles, then 12.  You should be able to PR every 12 weeks (during bulk phases) throughout the duration of your time doing intermediate, hypertrophy-focused training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodization&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#11&quot;&gt; isn’t overly important for hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;, but varying your training a bit simply helps keep workouts feeling fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split your training into bulking and cutting phases.  This generally allows you to gain muscle at a faster overall rate than attempting to gain it with minimal body fat fluctuations.  Aim to gain about half a pound per week until your body fat percentage reaches about 20-22% for men, and 28-30% for women, then slowly cut back down to 10-15% for men, and 20-25% for women, losing about 1% of your bodyweight per week.  I’d highly recommend&lt;a href=&quot;http://rippedbody.jp/how-to-bulk/&quot;&gt; this article&lt;/a&gt; for more in-depth details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t tie up too much of your time in training to peak for competitions.  A simple 3-4 week peak will be enough for most people to hit very solid lifts on the platform since you’re training the main lifts fairly heavy throughout this period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 480px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-02-13.46.551.png)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.strengthandconditioningresearch.com%2F2014%2F07%2F08%2Finjury-strength-sports%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHU0gKH0B1rhzIkx-cpyYjXxbKWvw)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;From strengthandconditioningresearch.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the reasons given above, a major reason to make your training more “bodybuilding-centric” during this phase is that bodybuilding-style training has an astoundingly low injury rate.  When looking at injury rates in various strength sports, bodybuilding generally fares considerably better than powerlifting, weightlifting, or strongman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 200px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Journey-Intermediate1.png)](http://i.imgur.com/mgyuxC6.png)

&lt;p&gt;Remember the importance of maintaining joint health over the long haul.  Yes, you can absolutely build a ton of muscle doing more heavy powerlifting-specific training&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/&quot;&gt; as long as you’re doing enough sets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the goal for this phase is to build that muscle while minimizing risk to set you up for greater long-term success, and even the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714538&quot;&gt; best study to date&lt;/a&gt; comparing volume-equated “powerlifting-style” vs. “bodybuilding-style” training found that, while they produced similar hypertrophy, getting that volume from heavier training caused more aches and general feelings of being worn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does this usually last?  Again, it depends on the person and how quickly they gain muscle (which is largely genetic).  It’s generally a period of 3-8 years.  The first time you gain less than 3-5 pounds of muscle (comparing at similar body fat percentages) in a year of consistent training and diet, it’s time to transition to advanced training and start wrecking worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-training&quot;&gt;Advanced Training &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#advanced-training&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you have most of the muscle you’re ever going to get (unless you’ve been drug-free to this point and decide to start taking vitamin S), so your job is to get everything you can out of it. That requires moving from proficiency to mastery with the lifts. Though by this point, you’ve already taken care of the low-hanging fruit in terms of neuromuscular improvements, there’s still room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s actually a surprising amount of neural coordination that goes into lifting really heavy stuff.  You have to activate the vast majority of the muscle fibers in your prime movers, you have to coordinate their contractions so that the sequencing of the lift is perfect (both intermuscular and intramuscular coordination), and then those muscle fibers have you contract and relax very rapidly (rate coding), and the more rapidly they can do so, the more force the muscle can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating the muscle fibers and coordinating the movement can both be learned with submaximal weights (about 80-85% of your max works nicely). However, there are slight changes in technique that take place with maximal loads (not form breakdown – the extra weight just changes how force is distributed throughout the system slightly), meaning the general coordination can be honed even further.  Additionally, rate coding (the speed at which the fibers can contract and relax) doesn’t start accounting for increases in muscular force until the muscle is already contracting at about 80-85% of its maximal force, meaning that it is also best trained with even heavier loads, and can still be improved upon once you reach the advanced level. Periodization also plays a larger role in advanced, purely strength-focused training, as it&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673040&quot;&gt; contributes more to strength development&lt;/a&gt; than muscle hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a general outline of how advanced training should be set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The offseason period is dedicated to building specific work capacity for the main lifts, meaning lots of submaximal training utilizing variants of the main lifts (high frequency, high volume, relatively low intensity, and high variation to decrease risk of overuse injuries).  This prepares your body to handle the very heavy loading necessary to drive mastery of the lifts with maximal weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the offseason, accessory work should be dedicated primarily toward fixing specific muscular weaknesses that are hindering performance in your main lifts.  Cut back on the amount of other “bodybuilding” work you do so more of your energy can be devoted to the main lifts.  It’s hard to mix high volumes of squat, bench press, and deadlift with equally high volumes of accessory lifts, making the latter a poor use of time and energy since you’re simply not going to achieve much extra hypertrophy from them anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you approach a meet, decrease training frequency and volume for each lift so you can increase intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the last ~6 weeks before a meet, be very conservative with accessory work.  That’s not enough time to add much extra muscle, and the more energy you use on accessories, the less you have to devote to your main lifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to maximize the number of high quality lifts you can get in with 85-95% of your 1rm while minimizing fatigue for the last 4-6 weeks before a meet.  You want to be as fresh as possible for each heavy session so your high output work can be as close to maximal output as possible (very high specificity necessary for mastery).  Your goal is to practice the lifts as much as possible in a hyper-specific manner, which necessitates very high loads and very low fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to compete about twice per year.  You want enough time between meets that you can reasonably improve your total each time you step on the platform, but you also want to practice competing so that you get practice managing meet-day nerves, picking attempts, cutting weight, etc.  You can certainly compete before reaching the advanced level, but this is when the skill of competing matters the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 200px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Journey-Advanced.png)](http://i.imgur.com/njQ7TPS.png)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Click to expand graphic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long can you continue improving once you’ve reached this level?  As with each of the other phases, it depends. There’s no reason you can’t keep improving until injuries start to set in, or until the aging process finally catches up with you.  You’ll never reach 100% technical perfection, so there’s always some room to improve there. You’ll also be able to continue gaining a little muscle each year.  Not a ton, but enough to make a small difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to point out something I didn’t state explicitly.  Beginner, intermediate, and advanced are defined in this guide by the primary factors limiting performance, NOT arbitrary strength standards.  How much you can lift at the end of each of these phases is mostly dependent on how well you chose your parents (the genetic hand you were dealt).  This isn’t a guide for breaking world records.  It’s a guide for reaching your own strength potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide has focused primarily on training.  However, I want to reiterate that training doesn’t take place in a vacuum.  Proper nutrition, sufficient sleep, and stress management all play just as big of a role as proper training, if not bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t get stronger in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t stop to consider this basic fact. At the end of a workout, you’ve accumulated some fatigue and you’re weaker than when you walked into the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get stronger outside the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do with this information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should make you look at training from a slightly different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking at training with the perspective of “I’m going to do this because it will make me bigger and stronger,” you should look at training thinking, “I’m sending my body a message, and I would like it to respond to that message by strengthening and growing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a semantic difference, but it’s an important one, because it helps put the entire training process in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it’s not the training itself that makes you bigger and stronger. It’s how your body RESPONDS to the training that makes you bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body adapts by responding to what it perceives to be a threat. When you work out, you’re sending your body the message that being forced to lift heavy weights is a “threat” (via stress to your muscles, bones, and connective tissues) that it needs to respond and adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good when lifting is the only major threat your body perceives. It will generally have no issues adapting to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you throw more threats at it? And what are these threats? Anything your body perceives as a significant stressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your body is trying to respond to multiple threats at the same time, it doesn’t respond quite as well to any of them. You can think of it as multitasking. If you’re trying to read a book, play a video game, and work on a project for school or work simultaneously, you won’t retain much of what you read, your kill:death ratio will be horrendous, and you’ll certainly do pretty lousy work on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most important threats that keep your body from responding well to training are lack of sleep and chronic life stress, such as a stressful job, a bad relationship, financial worries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going too much into the nuts and bolts of your body’s stress response, it meets these threats by making sure you have plenty of energy floating around your blood stream, available for use to keep you more alert and to make sure you’d be capable of fighting or running away if the situation called for it (for most of human history, those were the two basic ways we responded to most threats, hence the common term “fight or flight” response).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring you have enough available energy to meet these stressors is your body’s primary adaptive response. Most importantly for the context of lifting: This is an inherently catabolic (“breaking down tissue”) process. Your body breaks down stored glycogen and proteins to make sure you have enough available energy to respond to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s bad news for the lifter. Getting bigger and stronger is a fundamentally anabolic (“tissue building”) process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the stress from day-to-day life and lack of sleep tell your body it needs to be in a catabolic state, you’re going to have a hard time carrying out the anabolic process of building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get into the nitty gritty a bit more, there are already articles on Strengtheory about how lack of sleep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/sleep-pt-1/&quot;&gt;makes it harder to lose fat&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/poor-recovery-and-increased-muscle-breakdown-insufficient-sleep-part-2/&quot;&gt; gain muscle&lt;/a&gt;, and about how&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/stress-the-silent-killer-of-gains/&quot;&gt; chronic stress literally doubles how long it takes you to recover from lifting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right now, we can keep it simple. Training is like having a conversation with your body. You give it the message that it needs to get bigger and stronger via stress on the muscles, bones, and connective tissue. You hope it will respond to that message appropriately. But when stress builds up and you’re not sleeping enough (which is a stressor of its own, which also compounds the effects of whatever chronic stress you’re under), &lt;em&gt;you’re effectively sending your body mixed messages, telling it that it should both tear itself down and build itself up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is something similar to the multitasking scenario from earlier. It doesn’t do a very good job getting bigger and stronger, and the training stress makes you less able to cope with the stressors of day-to-day life and lack of sleep until eventually your body is so worn down that you completely burn out, often resulting in some sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20886307_Stress_Emotion_and_human_immune_function&quot;&gt;sickness or infection&lt;/a&gt;; when your body’s ability to respond to threats is overwhelmed, bacteria or viruses that would usually be stopped cold by your immune system are able to multiply enough that you wind up sick with a cold, flu, or respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So remember, when you’re trying to tell your body it needs to get stronger, you need to make sure you’re managing your day-to-day stress and sleeping enough, otherwise you’ll get nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/beginnergym/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn&#39;t much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it&#39;s not useful). If you&#39;re new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on my personal experience, and I&#39;m sure many of you will have &amp;quot;but my gym doesn&#39;t do it this way&amp;quot; comments, so please feel free to comment and I&#39;ll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let&#39;s talk about gyms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What and why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It&#39;s usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don&#39;t have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can&#39;t get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you&#39;re hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you would find at the gym&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reception&lt;/strong&gt;: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you&#39;re a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you&#39;re a member, they&#39;re there to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free weights&lt;/strong&gt;: this will be one of the the most common items you&#39;ll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tuffstuffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TuffStuff-Evolution-3-Tier-Dumbbell-Rack.jpg&quot;&gt;rack of dumbbells&lt;/a&gt;, but you&#39;ll also see free weights, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.titan.fitness/media/catalog/product/cache/8/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/6/86obar-v2-1_3.jpg&quot;&gt;Olympic barbells&lt;/a&gt;, benches, &lt;a href=&quot;https://samsfitness.com.au/image/cache/catalog/atx-fs-240/atx-professional-half-rack-800x800.jpg&quot;&gt;racks&lt;/a&gt;, and all sorts of muscular &lt;a href=&quot;http://5stepmarketing.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gym-owner.jpg&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ua.all.biz/img/ua/catalog/1949352.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance machines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/&quot;&gt;r/Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they&#39;re good for back exercises). Some of them will have &lt;a href=&quot;https://5.imimg.com/data5/FC/NY/MY-2277102/lat-pulldown-machine-500x500.jpg&quot;&gt;cables&lt;/a&gt;, some will have complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fitnessfactoryoutlet.com/images/products/12338.png&quot;&gt;levers&lt;/a&gt;, and almost all will have a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://sep.yimg.com/ay/fitnessgiant/legend-fitness-selectedge-shoulder-press-machine-1101-12.png&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noosaaquaticcentre.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noosa-Aquatic-Gym.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: these are typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://iconfitness-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive,fl_lossy,dpr_1.0,w_800/v1/site-51/NTL17219_gallery_1_L%402x.jpg&quot;&gt;treadmills&lt;/a&gt;, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They&#39;ll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They&#39;re probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body-weight and suspension area&lt;/strong&gt;: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://theclublg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TRX_SFrame.jpg&quot;&gt;suspension rack&lt;/a&gt;, and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/08/08/5b747cf380eb35045d8b4f36.png&quot;&gt;bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studios&lt;/strong&gt;: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dancestudioforfar.co.uk/s/cc_images/cache_8440126.jpg?t=1506983348&quot;&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn&#39;t an active class, and they&#39;re good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized equipment&lt;/strong&gt;: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It&#39;s worth asking about these if anything interests you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group exercise classes&lt;/strong&gt;: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender-specific areas&lt;/strong&gt;: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you&#39;re female and would a &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; environment, you can always ask about these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showers &amp;amp; sauna&lt;/strong&gt;: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you&#39;re planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal trainers&lt;/strong&gt;: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they&#39;re expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you&#39;ve been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you&#39;re an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chillout area&lt;/strong&gt;: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn&#39;t really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that&#39;s good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don&#39;t forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don&#39;t be discouraged! That&#39;s why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you&#39;ll be happy going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, once you&#39;ve settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn&#39;t initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won&#39;t need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you&#39;re trying to do: if it&#39;s weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you&#39;ve researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gym etiquette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you&#39;re unsure about something, ask. Unless they&#39;re in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weights&lt;/strong&gt;: if you&#39;re weightlifting, you&#39;re going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you&#39;re resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you&#39;re sharing equipment/machines, and you&#39;re listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you&#39;re ever spotting someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re using a bench or a seat, it&#39;s good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you&#39;re done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won&#39;t harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don&#39;t be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you&#39;re unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That&#39;s very true, but doesn&#39;t mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it&#39;s really about being considerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio&lt;/strong&gt;: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you&#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studio use&lt;/strong&gt;: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don&#39;t drop weights on the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body weight area&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure there isn&#39;t a class or someone else using the equipment. If it&#39;s an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it&#39;s a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group classes&lt;/strong&gt;: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.&lt;/p&gt;
