      <h1>The Absolute Beginner&#39;s Guide to the Gym</h1>

<span class="badge badge-secondary">03 Aug 2020</span>



<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!</p>
<p>I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn't much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it's not useful). If you're new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.</p>
<p>This is based on my personal experience, and I'm sure many of you will have &quot;but my gym doesn't do it this way&quot; comments, so please feel free to comment and I'll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let's talk about gyms!</p>
<p><strong>What and why</strong></p>
<p>A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It's usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don't have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can't get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you're hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.</p>
<p>Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.</p>
<p><strong>What you would find at the gym</strong></p>
<p><strong>The reception</strong>: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you're a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you're a member, they're there to help you out.</p>
<p><strong>Free weights</strong>: this will be one of the the most common items you'll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a <a href="https://www.tuffstuffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TuffStuff-Evolution-3-Tier-Dumbbell-Rack.jpg">rack of dumbbells</a>, but you'll also see free weights, <a href="https://www.titan.fitness/media/catalog/product/cache/8/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/6/86obar-v2-1_3.jpg">Olympic barbells</a>, benches, <a href="https://samsfitness.com.au/image/cache/catalog/atx-fs-240/atx-professional-half-rack-800x800.jpg">racks</a>, and all sorts of muscular <a href="http://5stepmarketing.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gym-owner.jpg">individuals</a> hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.</p>
<p><a href="https://ua.all.biz/img/ua/catalog/1949352.jpeg"><strong>Resistance machines</strong></a>: these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/">r/Fitness</a>, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they're good for back exercises). Some of them will have <a href="https://5.imimg.com/data5/FC/NY/MY-2277102/lat-pulldown-machine-500x500.jpg">cables</a>, some will have complex <a href="https://www.fitnessfactoryoutlet.com/images/products/12338.png">levers</a>, and almost all will have a small <a href="https://sep.yimg.com/ay/fitnessgiant/legend-fitness-selectedge-shoulder-press-machine-1101-12.png">guide</a> on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.</p>
<p><strong>Cardio</strong> <a href="https://www.noosaaquaticcentre.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noosa-Aquatic-Gym.jpg"><strong>equipment</strong></a>: these are typically <a href="https://iconfitness-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive,fl_lossy,dpr_1.0,w_800/v1/site-51/NTL17219_gallery_1_L%402x.jpg">treadmills</a>, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They'll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They're probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Body-weight and suspension area</strong>: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this <a href="https://theclublg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TRX_SFrame.jpg">suspension rack</a>, and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in &quot;<a href="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/08/08/5b747cf380eb35045d8b4f36.png">bootcamp</a>&quot; format.</p>
<p><strong>Studios</strong>: a <a href="http://www.dancestudioforfar.co.uk/s/cc_images/cache_8440126.jpg?t=1506983348">studio</a> is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn't an active class, and they're good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.</p>
<p><strong>Specialized equipment</strong>: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It's worth asking about these if anything interests you.</p>
<p><strong>Group exercise classes</strong>: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.</p>
<p><strong>Gender-specific areas</strong>: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you're female and would a &quot;safer&quot; environment, you can always ask about these</p>
<p><strong>Showers &amp; sauna</strong>: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you're planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).</p>
<p><strong>Personal trainers</strong>: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they're expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you've been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you're an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.</p>
<p><strong>Chillout area</strong>: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn't really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.</p>
<p><strong>Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?</strong></p>
<p>First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that's good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don't forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.</p>
<p>A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don't be discouraged! That's why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you'll be happy going to.</p>
<p>Second, once you've settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn't initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won't need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you're trying to do: if it's weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you've researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!</p>
<p>Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Gym etiquette</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.</p>
<p>Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you're unsure about something, ask. Unless they're in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Weights</strong>: if you're weightlifting, you're going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you're resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you're sharing equipment/machines, and you're listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you're ever spotting someone.</p>
<p>If you're using a bench or a seat, it's good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you're done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won't harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don't be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you're unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.</p>
<p>Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That's very true, but doesn't mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it's really about being considerate.</p>
<p><strong>Cardio</strong>: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you're done.</p>
<p><strong>Studio use</strong>: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don't drop weights on the wooden floor.</p>
<p><strong>Body weight area</strong>: make sure there isn't a class or someone else using the equipment. If it's an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it's a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Group classes</strong>: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.</p>
