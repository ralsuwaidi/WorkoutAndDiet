# Summary and overview

---

* Obesity and sustainable fat loss is quite complicated because it is affected by many factors and mechanisms
* Too little sleep might affect your ability to lose fat (via increased appetite, for example)
* Your reward system might affect your propensity to gain weight
* Exercise might affect appetite
* Exercise can act in synergy with caloric restriction to maintain/increase lean body mass while losing fat mass. The goal should be fat loss rather than weight loss (which includes loss of muscle mass).
* Early glycogen/water loss affects your perceived weight loss (especially for low-carb diets)
* The calories in calories out model is currently the theory with greatest scientific backing.
* Protein is good for satiety (fullness)
* Hormones like leptin, insulin, serotonin, and ghrelin are likely important for fat loss
* Some people may be genetically predisposed to obesity (hunger, willpower, motivation, etc.)
* The body might try to regain lost weight via different weight regulation mechanisms (metabolic, behavioural, hormonal, and more)
* L-Carnitine as a weight loss supplement?
* In short, it seems like we do not have as much control as we like to think we have. Most people who go on a diet, regain lost weight within a couple of years. Yet, there are many things we can do to improve our body composition.
* The previous study collection on protein can be found **[here](https://sci-fit.net/2017/collection-300-protein-studies/)**

[Predicting metabolic adaptation, body weight change, and energy intake in humans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2838532/): "Complex interactions between carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism underlie the body's remarkable ability to adapt to a variety of diets. But any imbalances between the intake and utilization rates of these macronutrients will result in changes in body weight and composition. Here, I present the first computational model that simulates how diet perturbations result in adaptations of fuel selection and energy expenditure that predict body weight and composition changes in both obese and nonobese men and women. (...) The validated model was used to estimate free-living energy intake during a long-term weight loss intervention, a variable that has never previously been measured accurately."
