      <h1>How To Make Gains Without A Gym</h1>

<span class="badge badge-secondary">03 Aug 2020</span>



<p>A lot of people are currently without gym access due to quarantines and lockdowns, so <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/"><strong>I wrote an article</strong></a> about how to go about maintaining your progress or making gains without gym access.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not a &quot;how to set up a home gym&quot; article (if you have the money and space for a home gym, gym closures probably aren't affecting you much), and it's not written with the assumption that you're planning on joining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/">r/bodyweightfitness</a> and never going to the gym again.  Rather, it's about strategies you can use to adapt &quot;normal&quot; strength or hypertrophy training for a period of time without gym access with minimal cost.</p>
<p>Since gyms are so ubiquitous (and affordable, in most places), I think most people just haven't ever had to think about how they'd train for weeks or months without a gym.  However, you can do some effective training with no equipment or very minimal equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;Push&quot; training is pretty easy; push-ups, bodyweight triceps extensions, and handstand push-ups are all good ways to train your pecs, triceps, and delts.  You can progress by increasing reps over time instead of increasing load, or you can progress to increasingly challenging variations of these exercises to increase intensity.</p>
<p>&quot;Pull&quot; training is a little more challenging with absolutely no equipment, but is quite a bit easier if you have an over-the-doorframe pull-up bar.  Without a pull-up bar, table rows are a great option, and you can add load by loading a backpack with books or other heavy household items.  If there are trees nearby, you can do pull-ups on a tree branch (again, using a backpack for added resistance).  And if you have some large water jugs, you can use them as dumbbells for curls.</p>
<p>Lower body training is more of a challenge.  Bodyweight squats probably come to mind first, but they're quite easy for people who are already in pretty good shape.  However, strict step-ups (just tapping your heel to the floor, and getting no assistance from your down leg) are WAY more challenging than a lot of people realize, even if you're just using your body weight as resistance, and are easy to progress since you probably have items of varying heights around your house.  Building toward pistols is also a great challenge.  And if you don't have knee issues, bodyweight sissy squats can also provide a great challenge to your quads.  For posterior chain training, single-leg glute bridges are surprisingly challenging, especially if performed strictly, and it's fairly easy to add load via a loaded backpack.  If you have someone or something to anchor your ankles, nordic hamstrings curls are HARD.</p>
<p>If you're willing to make just one purchase, you should seriously consider a set of bands.  It would be impossible to list every exercise you can do with a set of strong resistance bands, because the list would include virtually every exercise you could do with barbells or machines.  Bands also help you add resistance or assistance to virtually all bodyweight exercises.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, progressive overload is still the name of the game.  Instead of just adding more weight to the bar, you may need to be a little more creative.  With bodyweight exercises, you can either increase reps, or increase intensity by building up to more challenging versions of the exercises you're doing.  You can also increase weight via a loaded backpack for a lot of exercises.  For band exercises, you can either add more bands into the mix, or choke up on bands to increase intensity; you can also just add reps.  In general, as long as you have an objective way to make and measure progress, you should be able to maintain muscle pretty easily, and probably keep building muscle.  In terms of strength, your maxes may be down a bit once you can get back under a bar, but as long as you maintained or built muscle, any strength decrements should simply be due to rusty motor patterns, rather than &quot;true&quot; strength losses.</p>
<p>As long as you have a good idea of the exercises at your disposal, you shouldn't need to make any huge changes to a training program.  Just sub out your current exercises for other exercises that accomplish the same basic purpose, probably change the set/rep scheme (for people on strength programs, you're probably going to be looking at higher rep ranges for the time being), and keep the gains rolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/"><strong>Here's the link to the article again</strong></a>.  The meat-and-potatoes of it is the list of exercises at the end that you can do with no equipment or minimal equipment.  Most of them link out to pages or videos demonstrating/explaining each exercise.  Hopefully it's useful for folks who will be without gym access for the time being.</p>
