&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over six weeks, velocity-based training led to significantly larger gains in bench press strength and jump height than traditional percentage-based training in trained lifters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Across four lifts – squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift – strength gains were almost 50% larger with velocity-based training, in spite of the fact that training volume was slightly lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days, you hit the gym feeling great, and your prescribed workout barely challenges you. Other times, you’re tired and fatigued, and your performance in the gym is well below your usual level. Autoregulation strategies, which we’ve talked about in MASS many times before (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/531894/posts/1731725&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/494867/posts/1605125&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/566499/posts/1834911&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/603578/posts/1958255&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/422251/posts/1363036&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/903543/posts/2981795&quot;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt;), help you take advantage of the good days and pull back on the bad days in a logical, controlled manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method of autoregulation is via the use of velocity. As loads increase, mean concentric velocity decreases in an almost perfectly linear fashion. Because of this, you can use velocity as a stand-in for traditional percentages of 1RM for prescribing intensity. However, percentages of 1RM don’t change until the next time you max, whereas velocity is responsive to day-to-day fluctuations in strength, making velocity a prime candidate for autoregulation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, until now, we didn’t have firm evidence that autoregulating training using velocity actually led to larger strength gains than training with a traditional percentage-based approach. A recent study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30946276&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;) found that, in trained subjects, velocity-based training led to significantly larger increases in jump height and bench press strength than traditional percentage-based training  over six weeks. This finding puts autoregulatory strategies using velocity on a much firmer footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of velocity-based training and percentage-based training on strength and power adaptations after a six-week block of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research Questions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would velocity-based or percentage-based training lead to larger strength gains in the squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift after a six-week block of training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would velocity-based or percentage-based training lead to larger increases in counter-movement jump height after a six-week block of training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hypotheses were directly stated, but the wording of the introduction implies that the authors expected that velocity-based training would lead to larger gains in strength and counter-movement jump height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;subjects-and-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects and Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#subjects-and-methods&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subjects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 30 men that initially volunteered for this study, 3 got injured and 11 failed to meet all inclusion criteria, leaving a final sample of 16 subjects. Subjects were required to have at least two years of resistance training experience. They turned out to be a pretty well-trained sample by the standards of most research in the area; the average 1RM squat was a little over 1.5x bodyweight, and the average deadlift was nearly double bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/velocity-autoregulation/velocity-table-1/)&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Design&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study took place over approximately seven weeks, with a day of testing pre- and post-training, and six weeks of training. The pre-testing day took place at least 96 hours before the first training session, and the post-testing day took place at least 96 hours after the last training session. Testing consisted of counter-movement jump height and 1RMs for back squat, bench press, overhead press, and deadlift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training took place twice per week. Both days included back squat, bench press, and squat jump. Day 1 also included overhead press, seated rows, and walking lunges, while day 2 also included deadlifts, plyo push-ups, and barbell hip thrusts. The program itself included two three-week waves, with the first wave increasing in intensity from 70% 1RM to 85-88%, and the second wave increasing from 80-82% to 95%. More details about the training program can be seen in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/velocity-autoregulation/velocity-table-2/)&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group used a percentage-based program, and one group used a velocity-based program. The percentage-based program is the one in Table 2. In order to equate the two programs, the velocity-based group used velocity zones and velocity stops, rather than percentages and prescribed numbers of reps. Loads were dictated by the subject’s performance on each training day with the velocity-based program, so that when their velocities were higher or lower than normal, they could train with heavier or lighter loads to stay in the correct velocity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear how the velocity zones were defined in this study; the authors note that “group zones for each movement were created using a combination of previously published data and data collected within the pretesting 1RM assessments,” but no additional information is provided about how those two data sources were integrated or how they determined the size of each range. The velocity stops are a bit ambiguous as well. The authors state “velocity stops were integrated into each set at 20% below the target velocity of each specific zone.” They cite this paper (which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/531894/posts/1731725&quot;&gt;previously reviewed in MASS&lt;/a&gt;) as a reference (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038416&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), and in that study, they terminated each set when velocity dropped by more than 20% from the first rep in the set. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that’s what they did in this study. However, that statement could also be interpreted to mean that each set was terminated when velocity fell 20% below the bottom end of the target velocity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a non-negligible distinction, because their velocity targets seem to be fairly wide. For example, the velocity target for the squat to correspond to 70% 1RM was 0.74-0.88 m/s. If the velocity stop kicked in when rep speed dropped by 20% within a set, then someone whose first rep was 0.88m/s would terminate a set when their velocity dropped to 0.70m/s, and someone whose first rep was 0.74m/s would terminate a set when their velocity dropped to 0.59m/s. If the velocity stop kicked in when rep speed dropped to 20% below the bottom of the target range, then each squat set in this intensity range would terminate at a velocity of 0.59m/s, regardless of where the first rep fell in the 0.74-0.88m/s range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that I may just be being a bit too pedantic, since I’m sure I could do a bang-up job of approximating their target velocity ranges for each intensity, and since both potential interpretations of their velocity stop method would probably be fine in practice. However, for a study that’s this novel in the literature, I’d really like to know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how the velocity-based program was executed, but the methods section doesn’t provide me with enough information to know exactly how they prescribed loads and how they decided when to terminate each set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every article we review in MASS has an accompanying audio roundtable just like this one. All of the MASS reviewers (Greg Nuckols, Eric Trexler, Eric Helms, and Mike Zourdos) get together to discuss the findings and applications in practical, easy-to-understand terms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#findings&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both groups got significantly stronger in the squat, bench press, and overhead press. Only the velocity-based group got significantly stronger in the deadlift. Additionally, only the velocity-based group had a significant increase in counter-movement jump height. There were only significant between-group differences for the bench press and counter-movement jump. Overall, the velocity-based group added an average of 37.3kg to their four main lifts, while the percentage-based group added 25.1kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/velocity-autoregulation/velocity-figure-1/)&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, volume load (sets x reps x weight) was slightly – though significantly – lower in the velocity-based group for the squat, bench press, and overhead press. The overall difference in volume load was small (5.9%), but the velocity-based group was a little stronger at baseline (~8.4% stronger), so relative volume load (sets x reps x %1RM) was closer to 19% lower in the velocity-based group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really cool study that was much-needed. In the past decade, there’s been a lot of work digging into load-velocity profiles. We’ve reviewed several load-velocity papers for MASS already (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/1167606/posts/3869715&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/685832/posts/2239060&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/903543/posts/2981795&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/1241973/posts/4139397&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/494867/posts/1605125&quot;&gt;five&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/763793/posts/2500209&quot;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt;). However, with any new form of monitoring, or new way to assign training loads, the most important question is, “does this actually matter?” If it doesn’t ultimately help people reach their goals more effectively and efficiently, it’s ultimately just mental masturbation and overcomplication for the sake of feeling more in control. Now that we can see that using velocity to assign training loads actually leads to faster strength gains than using percentages, that lets us know that all of that work fleshing out the load-velocity literature wasn’t in vain (assuming these results replicate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I do have a few reservations about these results. First, this study was just six weeks long. Yes, that’s a cheap critique, and I don’t hold that against the authors (that’s still a TON of work), but it’s at least worth considering the possibility that results would have been different if the study ran longer. More substantially, I think there was an important confounding variable in this study: The subjects in the velocity-based group were told their velocity for each rep. Some research suggests that intentionally moving the bar as fast as possible leads to larger strength gains, and velocity feedback improves acute performance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734902&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29461412&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). An assumption with velocity-based training is that you move each rep as fast as you can. If you don’t, your velocity data is essentially worthless, since all of the ways you can prescribe training using velocity is predicated on the linear relationship between load and velocity, and between proximity to failure and velocity &lt;em&gt;when maximum effort is exerted&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, the velocity-based group a) knew (or at least should have known) that they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needed to put forth their full effort on each rep to make the velocity-based load and volume prescriptions work in the first place, and b) the velocity feedback on each rep essentially functions as external cuing (reminding you to move the bar fast). As MASS readers should know by now, external cueing improves performance (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271992035_Attentional_focus_and_motor_learning_A_review_of_15_years&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, the superior strength gains in the velocity-based group may have been due to the velocity-based training, but they may have been at least partially due to the constant velocity feedback. However, that &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be a distinction without a difference, as velocity-based training &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; force you to stay intimately aware of your velocity on each rep and &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; force you to move each rep as fast as possible, neither of which are typical (and certainly not required) for percentage-based programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I’m less skeptical of these results than I would be if velocity-based training didn’t have strong theoretical underpinnings. The idea just makes sense: On days you’re strong, a velocity-based approach will allow you to train with heavier loads or do more volume, and on days you’re weak and under-recovered, a velocity-based approach will have you pull back on your training loads and/or volume to allow you to recuperate. Over time, those small marginal advantages in each session, resulting from improved matching of training stress and readiness, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; lead to better results. I do think the ~50% faster average strength gains with velocity-based training in this study is pretty unrealistic (I think the effect they found is correct, but the relative magnitude of the effect is larger than the “true” magnitude), especially since the study ran just six weeks. I do think the theory is sound, though, and I feel even better about it now that it’s been directly tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the load prescription in this study could have been even more individualized. The authors used &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; velocity targets for each lift and intensity, whereas individualized targets would be easy to figure out, and would do an even better job of personalizing load prescriptions. I understand the decision completely: it would be a HUGE pain in the ass to come up with individualized velocity targets for each lift, each intensity, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; each subject (4 exercises x 9 different intensity targets x 16 subjects = 576 velocity targets you need to calculate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; keep track of, without making mistakes during data collection), but it’s entirely realistic for two individuals to move the bar at speeds that differ by 0.1-0.2m, even when performing the same exercise at the same intensity. Basically, if you put all training programs on a continuum from maximally rigid to maximally autoregulated, the method of assigning loads to the velocity-based group in this study would certainly be much closer to the maximal autoregulation pole than the maximal rigidity pole, but it could get even more personalized and autoregulation-y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you saw this study in a vacuum, it may surprise you. After all, the traditional group trained with higher absolute volume loads (and even higher relative volume loads) but still managed to gain less strength. However, results like this should be familiar to MASS readers. Mike &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/531894/posts/1731725&quot;&gt;covered a study&lt;/a&gt; a while back showing that terminating each set after a 20% velocity loss led to larger gains in jump height and &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; larger strength gains than terminating each set after a 40% velocity loss, even though volume load was way lower in the 20% velocity loss group (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27038416&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). For that study, I suggested that perhaps the 40% velocity loss group was just more fatigued at post-testing. However, that explanation doesn’t fly in this study. The second workout of week 6 is intentionally easy (2 sets of 3 with 70% 1RM), and post-testing didn’t take place until at least 96 hours after the last training session, so both groups rolled into post-testing after about a week of deloading. So, how can you equate for intensity, have a lower volume load, and still make larger strength gains? Intensity is the primary driver of strength gains (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28834797&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), and I think that staying further from failure during training helps ensure that subsequent workouts are also high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in making your own load-velocity profile and having your own personalized velocity targets, you can make a copy or download &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0yZHgcoMHBd6svLogkX_jf5GPWy4wMlJqpPTa1jXgQ/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; (do not request editing access) which will do most of the heavy lifting for you, as long as you have a device you can use to measure velocity in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I think the velocity feedback in one group and not the other could have biased the results of this study a bit. To remedy that, future studies should either a) provide velocity feedback to both groups or b) simply have the researchers encourage both groups to move every rep as fast as possible, without providing velocity feedback to either group (i.e. the researchers would be watching the velocities to know when an appropriate load has been reached, and would tell their velocity-based subjects when to cut a set and rack the bar based on velocity loss criteria).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-and-takeaways&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application and Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#application-and-takeaways&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a device for measuring bar velocity, you may be able to use velocity targets and velocity stops to create a training program that is more responsive to you and that will ultimately lead to faster strength gains. If you don’t, RPE stops and RPE load targets may work just as well, given the emerging work on RPE programs, which Mike reviewed this month.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2013, I showed up for a graduate school interview with a great deal of enthusiasm and a diverse array of potential research topics in my head. Later that year, I showed up to actually begin graduate school. I was about 40 pounds lighter, too depleted to display anything resembling enthusiasm, and my most pressing research question was now crystal clear: Why does dieting suck so much?&lt;br&gt;
As you might have inferred, I did a bodybuilding competition that year. This is a unique case of weight loss, in which the changes occur fairly rapidly, and the end goal is an exceptionally low body fat level. However, the rigors and challenges of weight loss are not entirely reserved for physique athletes, and the robust physiological defenses against weight loss apply to a wide variety of dieters. I began my graduate school career by writing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24571926&quot;&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; about the physiological hurdles we face in the weight loss process, which guided me toward a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422530&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt;. This three-part article discusses the problems we observed, the solutions I propose, and some suggestions to promote a smooth transition to life after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

The Problem: Metabolic Adaptation To Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#part-1.-the-problem%3A-metabolic-adaptation-to-weight-loss&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great irony of weight loss is that our modern problems were our ancient saviors. Think back to a much simpler time, before humanity was encumbered by desk jobs and student loan debt. Our evolutionary ancestors woke up each day for the purposes of obtaining nourishment, avoiding harm, and keeping the species viable, and that was enough for them. But this was also a time when food availability was highly uncertain. In terms of survival and reproductive success, fortune favored the individuals most able to store up energy when food was widely available, so they could rely on it when food was hard to come by. This is the general premise of the &lt;em&gt;Thrifty Gene Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;; while the hypothesis is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4057799/&quot;&gt;an oversimplification&lt;/a&gt; that fails to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; describe the modern epidemics of obesity and cardiometabolic disease, it remains a basic but useful conceptualization of the modern plight of dieters. Our ability to effectively store fat allowed our ancestors to stay alive during times of famine, but it also predisposed us to store a whole bunch of unwanted energy (fat) in an era of unprecedented food availability. Metabolic adaptation is an intentionally broad term that describes the collection of responses our body has to fight back against weight loss attempts and can be viewed as the “other side” of the &lt;em&gt;Thrifty Gene Hypothesis.&lt;/em&gt; While much attention has been dedicated to our ability to store fat during times of feast, metabolic adaptation addresses our body’s ability to use energy more economically in times of famine. With complementary systems to promote fat acquisition and oppose fat loss, we have been endowed with the gift (or curse) that made us perfectly suited to survive ancient famine &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; struggle with modern weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re talking about survival mechanisms, this article is written to address the challenges that come with somewhat intense weight loss attempts. A male that diets from 23% body fat to 18% body fat over a reasonable time frame is not coming face to face with his impending starvation, so the magnitude of adaptation is typically mild. When weight loss attempts become more extreme – either by losing huge amounts of weight, losing weight very rapidly, or pushing body fat storage close to the minimum amount required for survival – the adaptations become much more pronounced. While many equate metabolic adaptation (Figure 1) with an adaptive drop in energy expenditure, also known as &lt;em&gt;adaptive thermogenesis&lt;/em&gt;, the full breadth of metabolic adaptation also involves alterations in a wide range of hormones, neuroendocrine control of appetite, and even reproductive function. The specific sites of adaptation range from the most powerful control centers of the brain to the microscopic mitochondria within our cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image12-e1553620977989.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;A basic theoretical model of metabolic adaptation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mitochondrial-efficiency&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#mitochondrial-efficiency&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember high school biology class, you might know mitochondria as &lt;em&gt;the powerhouses of the cell&lt;/em&gt;, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the &lt;em&gt;energy currency of the cell&lt;/em&gt;. These two metaphors provide the basic foundation from which we understand macronutrient metabolism. When you want to use energy to make a biological “purchase,” such as protein synthesis, muscular movement, nerve transmission, or virtually anything else, you’re going to need to come up with the form of energy currency that is accepted. You take in dietary energy in the form of carbohydrate, fat, protein, and alcohol; this is like accepting payments in euros, Japanese yen, and Swiss francs, but living in a place where you can only use US dollars to make purchases. Macronutrient metabolism is the process by which these various currencies are converted to the currency you need (ATP), and mitochondria play a huge role in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review of macronutrient metabolism is well beyond the scope of this article, but a very simplified explanation will suffice. When we need some ATP, we ultimately funnel the majority of our stored or eaten energy toward two primary pathways: aerobic glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Both processes directly produce a little bit of ATP, but they also produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and/or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These make their way to the inner membrane of mitochondria, where the majority of total ATP production takes place in a process known as &lt;em&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/em&gt;. Electrons are passed from NADH and FADH2 down the &lt;em&gt;electron transport chain&lt;/em&gt;; this process causes protons to be pumped from inside the inner membrane to the space that exists between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. This establishes an electrochemical gradient, and the protons “want” to get back across the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If oxidative phosphorylation was 100% efficient, all of the protons would form an orderly line in front of the ATP synthase enzyme, use this transporter to cross back over the inner mitochondrial membrane, and ATP would be created in the process. But energy conversion isn’t 100% efficient. Consider the combustion engine in your car; the chemical energy of gasoline is converted to the mechanical energy of movement, but not with perfect efficiency. The inefficiency of this conversion results in heat production, to the extent that the engine requires a cooling system to help dissipate this excess heat. The human body is no different, and heat is the byproduct of our metabolic inefficiency. Under normal conditions, oxidative phosphorylation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770651&quot;&gt;is about 40% efficient&lt;/a&gt;, give or take. This means that roughly 40% of the available energy actually gets used for ATP production, with the remaining ~60% dissipated as heat. However, this efficiency can be altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When some of the protons in the intermembrane space circumvent ATP synthase and “leak” back across the inner membrane, ATP is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; produced in the process. In this case, the body completes the preliminary steps of metabolizing the macronutrient, releasing heat energy in the process, but doesn’t actually produce the ATP that makes the whole process &lt;em&gt;worth it&lt;/em&gt;. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322621/&quot;&gt;leakage&lt;/a&gt; is comprised of &lt;em&gt;basal proton leak&lt;/em&gt;, which is largely dictated by a transport protein called adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and the fatty acyl composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and &lt;em&gt;inducible proton leak&lt;/em&gt;, which is actively regulated by uncoupling proteins (UCPs). These proteins get their name from the term &lt;em&gt;uncoupled respiration&lt;/em&gt;, which describes the process in which energy substrates are metabolized but result in heat production rather than ATP synthesis. The infamous weight loss drug 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) works by uncoupling respiration; the result is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550200/&quot;&gt;potentially disastrous and sometimes fatal&lt;/a&gt; increase in metabolic rate and heat production. That is, of course, an extreme example that doesn’t occur with normal physiological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mammals, uncoupled respiration due to proton leak is a non-negligible contributor to energy expenditure, accounting for about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8897845/&quot;&gt;20-30% of resting metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt; in rats under normal circumstances. Proton leak is higher in warm-blooded animals than cold-blooded animals, and proton leak in mammals is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5646787/&quot;&gt;inversely related&lt;/a&gt; to body mass due to differences in body temperature regulation. So, proton leak probably accounts for a smaller percentage of metabolic rate in humans compared to rats. Nonetheless, its impact is large enough to have meaningful effects, as demonstrated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145158&quot;&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that proton leak correlates with weight loss success and that diet-resistant individuals with below-average weight loss outcomes tend to experience less proton leak. Aside from these apparently innate differences in proton leak between individuals, there is evidence to suggest that the magnitude of proton leak adapts in response to energy restriction and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the research pertaining to weight loss and proton leak is done in rodents; while this requires a small leap of faith in assuming that the results are relevant to human beings, it allows for an otherwise impossible level of experimental control. In rodents, studies using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736705&quot;&gt;short-term&lt;/a&gt; (two weeks to two months), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736705&quot;&gt;medium-term&lt;/a&gt; (six months), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15886224&quot;&gt;long-term&lt;/a&gt; (12 to 18 months) calorie restriction have reported decreased proton leak, which is indicative of an adaptive increase in mitochondrial efficiency. Conceptually, it appears that mitochondria sense the relative lack of energy availability and adapt in a manner that reduces wasteful proton leak. This increases the ability of mitochondria to meet their ATP-production “quota” while burning fewer calories in the process. Exactly how they go about doing this is a bit less straightforward. In these rodent studies, an unexpected but consistent observation was that UCP-3 protein content &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt;, which is counterintuitive; while proton leak decreased, this protein that facilitates proton leakage actually increased. Human studies, however, indicate the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10102249&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; evaluated UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels in lean, obese, and weight-reduced humans. They found that muscle levels of UCP-3 were reduced in people who had lost weight and stabilized at their reduced weight, which is intuitively consistent with reduced proton leakage. Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10096782&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by a different research group reported similar findings, with lower UCP-3 mRNA expression observed in individuals who had undergone prolonged energy restriction to induce weight loss. Perhaps the strongest evidence supporting the importance of proton leak and UCP-3 comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145158&quot;&gt;2002 study&lt;/a&gt; in which “diet-responsive” and “diet-resistant” individuals were classified based on weight loss results, then compared on a variety of parameters. Results showed that diet-responsive individuals lost 43% more weight, and this difference was accompanied by significantly higher rates of proton leak and UCP-3 mRNA levels. Taken together, it seems likely that rodents and humans share a common strategy in which mitochondrial proton leakage is reduced in response to energy restriction, as a fairly straightforward means of conserving scarce energy stores. While differing changes in UCP-3 expression between rodents and humans are less straightforward, it is possible that subtle distinctions exist with regard to the mechanisms by which they restrict proton leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-hormones&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Hormones&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-role-of-hormones&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncoupled respiration and proton leak are heavily mediated by hormonal controls. One of the most notable hormones affecting energy expenditure is thyroid hormone (TH; particularly the more biologically active form, triiodothyronine [T3]). Low TH levels are consistently associated with low metabolic rates, and high TH levels are consistently associated with high metabolic rates. Part of this effect is related to the fact that TH &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279015&quot;&gt;stimulates ATP-consuming processes&lt;/a&gt; and muscle ATP consumption, which increases the body’s overall demand for ATP. When ATP demand is increased, production increases to match, which requires us to burn more of the calories we consume and/or tap into our fat storage for energy. A substantial portion of TH’s effect on metabolic rate, however, is related to proton leak. Thyroid hormone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26347660&quot;&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; basal leak, with protons simply traversing the inner membrane itself or being transported via ANT, and also increases inducible leakage by stimulating UCP-3 expression and activation. In a large number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902316&quot;&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; studies, including both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222856/&quot;&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt; in physique athletes, an unfortunate reality of weight loss is a reduction in TH levels, which likely contributes to a reduction in proton leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormone also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718641/&quot;&gt;stimulates&lt;/a&gt; the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a type of fat tissue that specializes in uncoupled respiration. The primary purpose of BAT is to generate heat. Its mitochondria are loaded with uncoupling proteins; when BAT is activated, it burns calories like crazy, but yields a bunch of heat rather than ATP due to this uncoupling. While BAT makes substantial contributions to energy expenditure in small mammals and human babies, especially in cold conditions, it was long thought that humans do not have BAT in adulthood. Advances in research techniques have increasingly enabled researchers to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17473055&quot;&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; the presence of brown adipose tissue (and a similar thermogenic fat known as beige adipose tissue) in adults in amounts that could make small, but non-negligible, contributions to energy expenditure. While BAT is likely to play a very small role in the overall picture of energy expenditure during weight loss, reduced activation of this tissue via TH reductions may contribute to weight loss-induced reductions in uncoupled respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to metabolic adaptation, TH is definitely not the hormone assuming most of the blame. In fact, the observed drop in TH is influenced, at least in part, by a more influential hormone called leptin. Leptin is primarily produced by fat cells, but production is only high when they are full and happy. When we lose weight, our fat cells store less energy than they used to, and they begin producing less leptin as they shrink in size. Even before we lose a meaningful amount of weight, leptin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9084976&quot;&gt;drops substantially&lt;/a&gt; just from a few days of energy restriction, which is most closely related to the reduction of dietary carbohydrate (rather than fat or protein). The hypothalamus is a brain structure that serves as a key regulator of appetite and metabolism, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28356295&quot;&gt;leptin receptors in the hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt; allow fat cells to communicate their fullness directly to the brain. As we’ll see throughout this article, leptin is a high-profile mediator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829242/&quot;&gt;countless aspects&lt;/a&gt; of metabolic adaptation (Figure 2), eliciting effects on TH, reproductive hormones, hunger hormones, cortisol, and multiple components of energy expenditure. Metabolic adaptation entails a lot more than just reduced energy expenditure, and the widespread effects of leptin are a major reason for that. Staying on the topic of uncoupled respiration and BAT, high leptin levels stimulate the sympathetic nervous system via the hypothalamus, which results in activation of BAT and a resulting increase in energy expenditure. Leptin also stimulates thermogenesis (i.e., energy expenditure) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11943204&quot;&gt;directly&lt;/a&gt; in skeletal muscle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15556643&quot;&gt;independently of BAT&lt;/a&gt;. Weight loss studies consistently show &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/&quot;&gt;reduced leptin levels&lt;/a&gt;, with a corresponding reduction in energy expenditure. In addition, human BAT is indirectly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30141098&quot;&gt;activated by insulin&lt;/a&gt; as well. This insulin-mediated effect is most markedly promoted by high-carbohydrate meals, which, unfortunately, tend to be pretty hard to come by in the later stages of a weight loss diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image11-e1553621080968.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Leptin role in metabolic adaptation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also hormonal effects of energy restriction that extend beyond mitochondrial efficiency or adaptive thermogenesis. Several case studies have been carried out in physique athletes, and alterations in anabolic and catabolic hormones are pronounced and consistent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;One such case study&lt;/a&gt; documented reductions in testosterone while cortisol increased; our group did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;similar case study&lt;/a&gt; and found similar changes in testosterone and cortisol. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about whether or not post-exercise changes in testosterone play an important role in muscle growth, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172848&quot;&gt;common consensus is that they do not&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s critically important to distinguish normal, resting testosterone levels from short-term, post-exercise elevations. Resting testosterone levels do appear to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543675&quot;&gt;have an impact&lt;/a&gt; on the growth and maintenance of lean mass (&lt;em&gt;otherwise, professional athletes probably wouldn’t have consistently risked their careers to elevate it for the last several decades&lt;/em&gt;). Aside from its impact on BAT activation, insulin is also known to have anabolic properties. While there is some debate over how significant this effect is within normal physiological ranges of insulin, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300017&quot;&gt;study in bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt; documented a reduction in fasting insulin levels during contest preparation, and insulin changes were significantly correlated with changes in lean mass. This means that people who had larger insulin reductions tended to lose the most lean mass. However, it’s important to note that they also tended to lose more fat mass, so this could potentially just be demonstrating that some individuals preserved some additional lean mass by failing to get super lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased cortisol also contributes to the threat of lean mass loss while dieting. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have reported elevated cortisol late in contest preparation, which likely relates to the combination of energy restriction, training load, and the general stress that accompanies competition. Manipulating cortisol within normal physiological ranges has the capacity to alter the maintenance of body proteins, with higher levels &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6365973&quot;&gt;inducing protein breakdown&lt;/a&gt;. As we might expect, there are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422265/&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901578&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; studies showing pretty substantial loss of lean mass (more than 10 pounds of it) throughout contest preparation in male bodybuilders. Taken together, these collective hormonal disruptions during intensive weight loss threaten the ability to maintain lean mass throughout the diet. This is problematic for multiple reasons: the loss of lean mass directly opposes the goals of just about any athlete attempting to lose weight, lean mass is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1957828&quot;&gt;primary determinant&lt;/a&gt; of resting metabolic rate, and such a loss of lean mass is also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5945583/&quot;&gt;linked to excessive hunger&lt;/a&gt; until that lean mass is restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, loss of lean mass is not the only thing driving excessive hunger. Hunger is probably the most undesirable side effect of dieting for fat loss, and there are multiple hormonal responses that play a direct role in the urge to eat. Ghrelin is mainly produced in the stomach and is primarily known as a messenger to keep the brain informed about short-term energy availability. After a meal, the stomach produces less ghrelin, and the brain is aware that additional energy is not acutely necessary. During times of fasting, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11473029&quot;&gt;production increases&lt;/a&gt;, and levels ultimately get high enough to induce hunger. However, there is also evidence that ghrelin plays a role in sensing long-term energy availability, and diet-induced weight loss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12023994/&quot;&gt;increases 24-hour ghrelin levels&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;separate&lt;/a&gt; case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have documented increased ghrelin levels from the beginning to the end of contest prep in male bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously discussed leptin as a stimulator of BAT activity and muscle thermogenesis, but its hypothalamic duties do not end there. When leptin binds with its receptor in the hypothalamus, it initiates a domino-effect of signaling events that result in decreased neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), with increased pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). The result is that leptin stimulates energy expenditure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2777281/&quot;&gt;while also reducing hunger&lt;/a&gt;. A weight loss-induced drop in leptin therefore has the unpleasant bonus of reducing the number of calories you burn, while increasing your desire to consume more of them. We know insulin as a potentially anabolic hormone associated with lean mass retention, but it has appetite-related roles as well. Insulin receptors are present throughout multiple brain structures, including the hypothalamus, and insulin &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2777281/&quot;&gt;reduces appetite&lt;/a&gt; upon binding to these receptors. Cortisol comes into play here as well, as glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9075817?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;oppose the effects of leptin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s problematic enough that leptin is reduced during energy restriction and weight loss, but increases in cortisol also impair the biological function of the leptin that is still around, thereby amplifying the negative effects of low leptin levels. Cortisol also promotes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2822795&quot;&gt;fluid retention&lt;/a&gt;, at least in part by binding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4521600/&quot;&gt;mineralocorticoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342316/&quot;&gt;receptors&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17869482/&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with appetite stimulation and increased cravings for palatable foods. Collectively, chronic elevation of cortisol can promote loss of lean tissue, make weight loss &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; to stall by increasing water retention, exacerbate the effects of low leptin levels, and potentially increase urges to overeat. As weight loss causes increases in ghrelin and cortisol with reductions in leptin and insulin, this four-pronged attack on your hunger regulation yields a very unhappy dieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormonal adaptations to weight loss also have the capacity to interfere with reproductive function, thereby amplifying the unhappiness. Intuitively, this makes a great deal of sense from an evolutionary perspective. Low energy availability is perceived as a sign of insufficient resources in the environment, which is only exacerbated by the energy cost of gestation and further division of resources to accommodate a population increase via reproduction. During contest preparation, male testosterone levels don’t just &lt;em&gt;drop&lt;/em&gt;, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;plummet&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the obvious threat to muscle mass retention, lack of libido is a very common complaint of male physique athletes late in the contest preparation process. Similarly, female athletes typically experience a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222856/&quot;&gt;drop in estradiol&lt;/a&gt; in response to contest prep, along with menstrual cycle disruption. The severity of this disruption may depend upon a variety of factors, including acute energy availability, magnitude of overall weight loss, body fat percentage, and genetic predisposition. In less severe cases, menstruation may simply become more irregular; in more severe cases, menstruation may cease altogether. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133123/&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; of a female figure competitor revealed that menstruation became disrupted early in the contest preparation process, had ceased by the end of prep, and did not return until a full 71 weeks after competition. These reproductive side effects are not to be taken lightly; in addition to being generally unpleasant, there are long-term consequences to maintaining a prolonged state of sex hormone suppression, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620037&quot;&gt;impaired bone health and fertility&lt;/a&gt;. The primary hormonal adaptations to weight loss are summarized in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/metAd-figures-3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;metabolic adaptations hormones&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the previous sections would suggest, I prefer not to think of metabolic adaptation as &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a drop in metabolic rate. Rather, I prefer to conceptualize it as a multifaceted set of adaptations that involves regulation of energy expenditure, appetite, reproductive function, and the balance between anabolism and catabolism. In recent years, the International Olympic Committee has used the term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24620037&quot;&gt;“relative energy deficiency in sport,”&lt;/a&gt; or “RED-S,” to summarize a similar physiological state. The biological goal is to constrain energy use during times of underfeeding, but the effects are widespread, and to discuss them in isolation from one another is a bit short-sighted. Despite this wide variety of adaptations to weight loss and energy deficiency, the drop in energy expenditure, also known as adaptive thermogenesis, is the one that garners much of the attention in the fitness world. Up to this point, we’ve mentioned energy expenditure in a couple of esoteric contexts that have yet to be linked together in a cohesive manner. We have talked about proton leak, brown adipose tissue activation, and hormones related to ATP consumption and thermogenesis. But physique athletes and other dieters rarely utter a single one of those words in day-to-day conversation about dieting. So, it’s time to put some of these concepts together to discuss the aspect of metabolic adaptation that everyone cares about: energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;effects-on-energy-expenditure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects on Energy Expenditure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#effects-on-energy-expenditure&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of metabolic adaptation on energy expenditure are the ones everyone cares about, because they’re the ones we actually tend to &lt;em&gt;act on&lt;/em&gt; by manipulating our diet and exercise protocols. It becomes apparent that our energy expenditure is lower when our weight loss slows down, so we have to either reduce food intake or increase cardio, and we’d much prefer to do neither. But before getting into specific aspects of metabolic rate adaptations, we need a quick primer on energy expenditure in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day we consume energy and we burn energy; the net balance of this equation determines whether we gain or lose weight. As indicated in Figure 4, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) describes the total number of calories we burn in a given day, and TDEE is made up of four components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basal Metabolic Rate (~70% of TDEE in general population)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This describes the energy required to simply keep our body “on,” at rest, assuming we lay in bed all day without moving or eating.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image9-e1553621179528.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;components of total daily energy expenditure – metabolic adaptation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tie up some loose ends, let’s consider a few terms we have mentioned haven’t yet fully contextualized. We know that brown adipose tissue increases thermogenesis, particularly in response to cold exposure, thyroid hormone, leptin, and insulin; BAT thermogenesis would therefore primarily affect basal metabolic rate and the thermic effect of feeding. We noted that thyroid hormone and leptin increase mitochondrial uncoupling and muscle thermogenesis; these broad effects would have the potential to affect essentially all components of energy expenditure. So, all of the mitochondrial and thermogenesis-related concepts previously discussed fit &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; within our four components of energy expenditure, and sometimes span multiple components. Unfortunately, when we embark on a weight loss diet, all four components are influenced to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thermic Effect of Feeding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In weight loss diets, the thermic effect of feeding will be reduced for a very straightforward reason, with no need for any biologically adaptive explanation: If you eat less food, you won’t burn as many calories in the process of eating, digesting, metabolizing, and storing it. It remains unclear whether or not we have an adaptive shift in the thermic effect of feeding (that is, a disproportionate increase in the efficiency with which we handle the energy cost of feeding). While there are some isolated studies suggesting that a small adaptation favoring a relatively lower thermic effect of feeding does occur, the collective evidence would suggest that any such adaptation is negligible in magnitude. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8491165&quot;&gt;Miles et al&lt;/a&gt; found that feeding caused subjects to burn 13% of the calories consumed in an experimental meal before weight loss. After losing ~7.3 kg over a 12-14 week period, participants burned 12.5% of the calories consumed in the very same meal; this amounts to a difference of 3 Calories. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212/&quot;&gt;Leibel et al&lt;/a&gt; carried out an ambitious study in which some subjects were over-fed to induce weight gain, and others were under-fed to induce weight loss. Their results showed that weight gain from intentional overfeeding did reduce the energy efficiency of feeding, leading to a relatively greater thermic effect of feeding. In contrast, weight loss from intentional under-feeding did not increase this efficiency, and the thermic effect of feeding was not significantly different when comparing baseline values to the values obtained after weight loss. Overall, the body of evidence suggests that the thermic effect of feeding is lower during weight loss dieting, but this is caused by lower overall food intake and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8878356/&quot;&gt;less sympathetic nervous system activation&lt;/a&gt; in response to caloric intake. If there is any adaptation that makes us more efficient with regard to this thermic effect, it is very small in magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basal Metabolic Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A true “basal” metabolic rate is difficult to measure. It requires an overnight laboratory visit to allow for metabolic rate assessment directly upon waking, in the absence of food intake or substantial movement. As a result, labs that are not equipped to house overnight guests often use resting metabolic rate as a surrogate measurement. They still require subjects to fast overnight, but they let the subject come to the lab in the morning. To account for the movement associated with transportation to the lab, they have the subjects lay down and rest for a while before the actual measurement occurs. Under these conditions, resting metabolic rate can be used as a pretty solid representation of basal metabolic rate, and the terms are often used fairly interchangeably in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight loss typically involves the loss of both fat mass and fat-free mass; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280423&quot;&gt;fat mass&lt;/a&gt; is a metabolically active tissue, and fat-free mass is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1957828&quot;&gt;primary determinant&lt;/a&gt; of energy expenditure at rest. As a result, we fully expect resting metabolic rate to drop as we lose weight. In many cases, the drop in resting energy expenditure is greater than we would expect based purely on the loss of tissue, which suggests that an energy-conserving adaptation has taken place. The study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212/&quot;&gt;Leibel et al&lt;/a&gt; that evaluated the thermic effect of feeding also evaluated resting energy expenditure; their results indicated that resting metabolic rate was reduced following weight loss, even when accounting for the amount of fat-free mass lost. While there are some studies showing no effect of weight loss on resting metabolic rate, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10357728/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the topic supports the findings of Leibel et al and suggests that resting metabolic rate is indeed slightly lower in weight-reduced individuals compared to controls. These data match up quite favorably with data obtained from competitive physique athletes. For example, case studies have reported drops in resting metabolic rate that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;far exceed&lt;/a&gt; a magnitude attributable to lean mass loss and have shown resting metabolic rates to be consistently lower than predicted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;accounting for&lt;/a&gt; the amount of lean mass. These low values in physique athletes are almost certainly related to the acute effects of energy restriction at the time of measurement, but the loss of fat mass is most likely a contributing factor. Collectively, the evidence would suggest that weight loss typically induces a small (but not negligible) adaptive effect that reduces resting energy expenditure, and that this is observed in both non-athletic populations and competitive physique athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Activity Thermogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise activity thermogenesis is a tough one, because we directly control it. You decide how much weight training and cardio to do, so you have the capacity to influence it substantially. For the sake of this article, we’ll just consider the &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; energy efficiency of exercise, which describes how much energy you burn for a fixed amount of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple “non-metabolic” reasons why you could use less energy for the same amount of cardio as your weight loss diet progresses forward. For any kind of locomotive cardio, such as walking, running, or cycling, the task itself involves generating enough force to transport the mass of your body. As you lose weight, the mass is reduced, and you naturally require less energy to transport your body a given distance. Even for some non-locomotive tasks like stationary cycling, weight of the limbs is reduced, so &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less energy is required to perform the same amount of cycling work. Another factor that is rarely discussed relates to the fact that a lot of people, myself included, do absolutely no cardio unless required to. Many forms of cardio are trainable skills that we become substantially more proficient at as we do them more frequently throughout a weight loss attempt. Using running as an example, there are about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4555089/&quot;&gt;22 factors&lt;/a&gt; (give or take) that relate to running economy. Many of them are trainable, meaning that a novice runner can probably make substantial improvements to their running economy over the course of a few months. While this improvement in running economy is great for your joints, it also means you’re probably covering the same distance with greater efficiency, and therefore burning fewer calories in the process. Aside from these predictable reductions in exercise activity thermogenesis in response to a weight loss attempt, there are also metabolic adaptations that increase energy efficiency and reduce energy expenditure during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Columbia did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609816&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which participants completed a cycling test at their normal body weight, then repeated the test after either gaining or losing 10% of their body weight. As the researchers hypothesized, muscle work efficiency at lower exercise workloads was increased following weight loss and decreased following weight gain. This means that weight gain caused the participants to use more energy to produce the same amount of physical work, whereas weight loss caused the participants to use less energy to produce the same amount of work. Several years later, the same lab group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806213/&quot;&gt;replicated&lt;/a&gt; their finding, observing that muscle work efficiency was increased by weight loss and decreased by weight gain. One concern might be that the participants’ legs weighed less after weight loss, which may affect the energy expenditure of cycling. Fortunately, the researchers used little weights in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609816&quot;&gt;one of these studies&lt;/a&gt; to replace the leg weight that was lost; while the magnitude of the effect was smaller after weight replacement, a significant effect remained. So, it’s likely that exercise activity thermogenesis does indeed decrease (relatively speaking) throughout the course of a contest prep, and this effect is not &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; the result of a lighter body or technique-related improvements in exercise economy. This relative decrease can certainly be offset by increasing the absolute amount of exercise. However, as we’ll see in Part 2, such a decision is not without drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is the final component to discuss, and it is unequivocally the most influential when it comes to adaptive thermogenesis. Part of its impact relates to its capacity to be so incredibly variable. If I know your body size and composition, I can give a pretty good estimate of your resting metabolic rate. If I know your macronutrient intakes, I can give a pretty good estimate of your thermic effect of feeding. But two individuals of similar body size can have a daily &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/&quot;&gt;difference of up to 2,000 Calories&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to NEAT. This variability is huge but not surprising when you consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/&quot;&gt;wide range of factors that can affect NEAT&lt;/a&gt;. The hypothalamus plays a primary role in regulating NEAT, in conjunction with components of the hindbrain and mesolimbic system. The degree of NEAT is likely to vary based on occupation, sex, age, and season, and the exact cues that feed into these regulatory centers include temperature, activity level, food intake, body composition, and a large number of neuroendocrine inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mathematically quantify the importance of NEAT in adaptive thermogenesis, let’s use the approximate numbers presented in a review by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum and Leibel&lt;/a&gt;, who are absolute legends in this area: When a person loses 10% or more of their body weight, their total daily energy expenditure drops by around 20-25%. Some of this drop relates to the loss of body mass, but there is also an adaptive component, as total daily energy expenditure ends up about 10-15% below what we would expect based on body mass alone. Of that adaptive component, up to 85-90% can be explained by alterations in non-resting energy expenditure, and NEAT is by far the biggest contributor. For an experimental example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3173112&quot;&gt;Weigle et al&lt;/a&gt; studied the effects of a 23% weight loss on energy expenditure. The results indicated that total energy expenditure was about 24% lower than could be explained by the loss of fat-free mass, but resting metabolic rate was only 2-3% lower than predicted. Taken together, these observations would suggest that weight loss induced a fairly substantial reduction of energy expenditure, and this reduction was largely attributable to reductions in NEAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with NEAT is that it can be a bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/&quot;&gt;difficult to measure&lt;/a&gt; in an accurate and affordable manner. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3173112&quot;&gt;Weigle et al&lt;/a&gt; made use of controlled feeding protocols, daily weight changes, and linear regression to make inferences about NEAT. One of the classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11010936&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; regarding weight loss and NEAT was not actually intended to study either topic and can be objectively categorized as a very fortuitous mistake. A small group of people were placed in a 3-acre dome, which was intended to be a completely closed, self-contained world with a variety of biomes, much like a dome we could theoretically set up on a moon or a different planet. This is more or less the exact plot of a 1996 Pauly Shore &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-Dome&quot;&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; that received an implausibly low &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/biodome&quot;&gt;4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;. You could argue that the study fared a bit better than the film, but it was not without some stumbling blocks. Most notably, the Biosphere inhabitants were supposed to grow all of their own food, but they were unable to successfully grow enough calories to support their energy needs. As a result, the study became an unintentional weight loss study that lasted a full two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the first six months, subjects lost 14% of their body weight, which was maintained until leaving the dome. A week after leaving the dome, energy expenditure was assessed via a 23-hour confinement in a respiratory chamber and compared to control subjects. Total energy expenditure was suppressed in the Biosphere residents compared to controls, and this difference persisted after adjusting for relevant characteristics (age, sex, fat mass, and fat-free mass). When in the respiratory chamber, control subjects had nearly twice as much spontaneous physical activity (fairly synonymous with NEAT) than the Biosphere residents. When total energy expenditure was adjusted for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; factor, the difference between Biosphere subjects and control subjects was no longer significant, which further highlights the huge impact that NEAT has on energy expenditure during weight loss. Lending further support to these findings, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7632212/&quot;&gt;Leibel et al&lt;/a&gt; found a significant reduction in energy expenditure that was not attributable to resting metabolic rate, the thermic effect of feeding, or the loss of lean mass following 10-20% body weight reduction. A separate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609816/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; had participants either gain or lose 10% of their body weight, then maintain it. Weight loss resulted in an absolute non-resting energy expenditure reduction of 37.5%, whereas weight gain increased non-resting energy expenditure by 60.2%. Linear regression showed that the change in non-resting energy expenditure explained 78% of the observed change in total energy expenditure among both groups. As summarized in Figure 5, it is very clear that weight loss causes a disproportionate drop in total energy expenditure, and it is clear that NEAT is the primary component driving this effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original question posed was, “Why does dieting suck so much?” It turns out, the research literature offers us a variety of answers to that question. Weight loss attempts are met with changes in mitochondrial function, hormone levels, and energy expenditure. These changes produce some unpleasant side effects, threaten our ability to gain (or even keep) muscle mass and strength, manipulate biological cues pertaining to the regulation of appetite and activity level, and require us to eat even fewer calories or incorporate even more cardio into our training program. When metabolic adaptation first became a big conversation in the fitness scene, it was treated as a controversial topic. However, the content discussed in Part 1 of this article is objectively noncontroversial. The scientific literature has rigorously and repeatedly shown downregulation of energy expenditure, and the long list of physiological changes that accompany it, in response to weight loss. The controversy comes from how some of this information has been discussed, such as implausible anecdotes of fat gain despite remarkably low caloric intake, or the use of less rigorous terms like &lt;em&gt;starvation mode&lt;/em&gt;. Rest assured, there is not a single member of our species that can elude the inescapable grasp of starvation; our caloric needs for weight loss may fluctuate from person to person, but we all have a number. Furthermore, nobody is failing to lose fat because they are eating too few calories. Metabolic adaptation places speed bumps in our path to fat loss, no more and no less. But this raises the next important question: Can we do anything to circumvent these speed bumps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-2.-the-solutions-to-metabolic-adaptation&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2. The Solutions to Metabolic Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#part-2.-the-solutions-to-metabolic-adaptation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in Part 1, one of the more pressing concerns we face during weight loss is a reduction in energy expenditure. Part of this is a result of reducing our body size, but part is also a disproportionately large reduction in total energy expenditure that is mediated by a variety of mechanisms involving the mitochondria, hormone levels, and the brain. We don’t really observe a relative drop in the thermic effect of feeding during weight loss, and the drop in resting metabolic rate is fairly modest in magnitude. But the more notable changes are related to non-resting energy expenditure and skeletal muscle work efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leptin is one of many factors contributing to reductions in energy expenditure, but it is a key one. This hormone is reliably reduced during and following weight loss, and it directly communicates the fullness of adipocytes to the hypothalamus, a brain structure with huge impacts on energy expenditure, hormone levels, and hunger. Intuitively, this has led researchers to wonder if leptin replacement injections would help resolve many of the unwanted changes associated with low leptin levels. The good news is that experiments have shown this to be an effective strategy, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/&quot;&gt;leptin replacement injections reversing the drops&lt;/a&gt; observed for total energy expenditure, non-resting energy expenditure, skeletal muscle work efficiency, thyroid hormone, and gonadotropic hormones that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11824513&quot;&gt;link leptin levels with sex hormones and reproductive function&lt;/a&gt;. As an added bonus, leptin administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260066/&quot;&gt;reverses the hyperphagia&lt;/a&gt;, or extreme hunger, observed with weight loss. The bad news is that you can’t just walk down the street and buy some pharmaceutical-grade leptin, and even if you could, it’d be really expensive. So, for our purposes, leptin replacement is off the table, and we shift our focus toward more practical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;dealing-with-reductions-in-energy-expenditure&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing With Reductions in Energy Expenditure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#dealing-with-reductions-in-energy-expenditure&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we know that the reduction of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is a huge contributor to the reduction of energy expenditure observed with weight loss, there isn’t much we can consciously do about that in terms of physical activity. Of course, we could try to be mindful of non-exercise activity during weight loss in a qualitative sense. Consider a basic example: My mailbox is about 100 feet away from my front door. I get to the front door and realize I haven’t checked the mail in a couple of days. If I’m not in contest prep, I am almost certainly walking over and checking; when I’m in contest prep, it’s far less likely. When I’m not prepping, I tend to pace around the room when I do my heavy thinking. During prep, this doesn’t happen. These small, subconscious decisions accumulate throughout the day, in addition to the stuff that is virtually imperceptible, such as the energy spent maintaining posture or fidgeting in your chair. For most people, I encourage them to simply let this stuff go. Nobody wants to feel like a hamster on a wheel, constantly forcing themselves to continue some type of pointless motion. For a lot of people, the psychological burden of trying to consistently increase NEAT costs way more than the value it returns. Some people try to maintain a particular step count during a weight loss diet using a pedometer, or plan short walks throughout the day to stay active; this is a reasonable middle ground, as long as it doesn’t drive you crazy. Nonetheless, the more practical and broadly advisable strategies for fighting metabolic adaptation involve manipulating the overall rate of weight loss and using nonlinear diet strategies such as refeeds or diet breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rate of Weight Loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to maintain lean mass and attenuate metabolic adaptation, it is advisable to avoid excessively rapid weight loss. There are two main drivers pushing metabolic adaptation: short-term energy availability, and long-term depletion of energy stores. When actively dieting to become very lean, both stimuli are encountered; &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; degree of energy restriction is unavoidable for active weight loss, and depletion of fat stores is the entire goal of the process. While the endpoint of our diet (very low body fat) is going to bring its fair share of unavoidable adaptations, we can certainly exacerbate some of the short-term stimuli for metabolic adaptation by imposing an excessively large deficit to yield more rapid results. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822830/&quot;&gt;Mero et al&lt;/a&gt; studied the effects of two rates of weight loss in recreationally trained women; while losing 1kg per week successfully yielded more weight loss than 0.5kg per week, this came with a significant reduction in total and free testosterone levels. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21558571&quot;&gt;Garthe et al&lt;/a&gt; studied weight loss in a group of elite athletes, with one group losing 1.4% of their body mass per week and the other losing 0.7% per week. In order to prevent total weight loss from skewing the results, the slow weight loss group dieted for about 60% longer (5.3 weeks versus 8.5 weeks). Both groups lost the same amount of total weight, but the fast weight loss group lost a small amount of lean mass, whereas the slow weight loss group experienced a significant gain of lean mass. The slow weight loss group also had more favorable increases in maximal bench press, bench pull, squat, and countermovement jump performance. Results of this study are in line with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-20&quot;&gt;2014 review&lt;/a&gt; of bodybuilding contest preparation recommendations, in which weight loss rates of 0.5 to 1.0% of body mass per week are recommended. While these studies provide evidence that slower rates of weight loss are generally advisable, they assume linear calorie reduction. A different, and especially intriguing, way to alter the timeline of weight loss is to implement nonlinear approaches that transiently increase or decrease caloric intake for hours, days, or even weeks at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intermittent or Non-Linear Caloric Restriction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been understood that weight loss is induced by an energy deficit, but an energy deficit doesn’t necessarily need to be applied in a linear fashion. For example, let’s say we intend to induce a daily caloric deficit of 300 Calories per day. Over a 30-day month, we intend to eat 9,000 fewer Calories than we burn. But we have to decide exactly how to allocate those calories within each day, within each week, and within the month. There are some aspects of metabolic adaptation that are driven by getting really damn lean, or reducing the relative degree of energy stored in our body. There probably isn’t much we can do about those stimuli, especially for a physique athlete attempting to approach semi-starvation levels of leanness. But dietary strategies have emerged that absolutely alter acute fluctuations in energy availability; these strategies have assumed a variety of time scales, managing the way calories are distributed on an hour-to-hour, day-to-day, or week-to-week basis. But do any of these strategies manipulate acute fluctuations in energy availability in a manner that meaningfully attenuates aspects of metabolic adaptation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating the energy deficit within a day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the hour-to-hour time frame, there are a couple of strategies to consider: manipulation of overall meal frequency, and time-restricted feeding windows. When it comes to affecting energy expenditure, high meal frequency is on page one of the bodybuilding nutrition folklore manual. The premise is that eating causes an acute increase in energy expenditure (via the thermic effect of feeding), so frequent meals serve to &lt;em&gt;stoke the metabolic furnace&lt;/em&gt; throughout the day, keeping metabolic rate elevated. I suppose you could also stretch this to suggest that by providing a more consistent influx of calories, &lt;em&gt;starvation mode&lt;/em&gt; is kept at bay. However, research has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070624/&quot;&gt;consistently indicated&lt;/a&gt; that increased meal frequency has no meaningful impact on the thermic effect of feeding, resting metabolic rate, or total daily energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular strategy essentially aims to accomplish the opposite; rather than eating equally spaced meals throughout the day, time-restricted feeding encourages dieters to eat all of their meals within a quite narrow time window each day, often spanning 4-8 hours (Figure 6). This strategy, sometimes called &lt;em&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/em&gt; within the fitness world, aims to capitalize on the purported benefits of long fasting periods while still allowing for daily food intake. When it comes to time-restricted feeding, we still have a lot to learn. Only a handful of studies have been published to date, and methodological approaches vary quite a bit. Studies by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27550719&quot;&gt;Tinsley et al&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635036/&quot;&gt;Gill et al&lt;/a&gt; opted not to match caloric intake between the time-restricted feeding and control groups. Their results generally suggest that time-restricted feeding windows are a viable method for indirectly reducing caloric intake; great information, but not what we are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0?__s=ovzgowspzgzjrjm83r95&quot;&gt;Moro et al&lt;/a&gt; carried out a study that attempted to match caloric intake between time-restricted and standard feeding groups during an eight-week resistance training program, but caloric intakes were set based on self-reported diet data. To their credit, they had frequent check-ins with a dietitian to monitor compliance, which is as much as you can do without actually preparing and feeding the meals to subjects. The time-restricted group lost about 1kg of weight and the control group gained about 0.2kg, but dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry results suggested a preferential fat loss in the time-restricted group (1.6kg vs. 0.3kg). Overall, it’s hard to consider this a clear “win” for time-restricted feeding. Based on very modest changes in body weight, reliance on self-reported data for setting diets, a free-living intervention without controlled meal preparation, and potential variability in responses to the resistance training program, it’s probably safest to interpret these results as time-restricted feeding being as good, with the possibility of being better, than standard feeding. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645638/&quot;&gt;Stote et al&lt;/a&gt; exerted a little more rigorous control over their crossover trial in which participants completed eight weeks of time-restricted feeding and eight weeks of standard feeding. They tried to match caloric intake between conditions by feeding subjects dinner in the lab and providing packed breakfast and lunch meals, but they ran into a little issue; while subjects undergoing the time-restricted feeding protocol reported higher indices of hunger on surveys taken before their daily meal, they also reported extreme fullness after the meal and struggled to finish all of the food. The subjects did lose about 1.4kg of weight over eight weeks of time-restricted feeding, but also consumed 65 fewer Calories per day compared to their standard feeding protocol. When considering day-to-day variability of weight, and this cumulative difference of more than 3600 total Calories throughout the eight-week trial, a 1.4kg difference seems like a wash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of control, a recent study conducted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot;&gt;Sutton et al&lt;/a&gt; definitely takes home the grand prize. All meals were prepared by laboratory staff and consumed in the lab, under direct supervision, utilizing a crossover design. Caloric intakes were matched over each five-week feeding period (time-restricted and standard), and the laboratory staff deliberately set caloric content of meals to prevent weight loss (they were specifically interested in looking at the effects of altering feeding windows &lt;em&gt;in the absence&lt;/em&gt; of weight loss). They found that weight was maintained pretty effectively, with only a 0.5kg difference between the groups. The authors suggest that this difference, which favored an additional 0.5kg of weight loss in the time-restricted group, may be attributable to less glycogen storage as a result of longer fasting durations. In the other studies that attempted to match calorie intake and observed a slight fat loss benefit from time-restricted feeding, I have interpreted the favorable results with hesitation. Part of this hesitation, as previously discussed, is uncertainty over exactly how well calories were truly matched. However, my hesitation is also related to the lack of a strong mechanism that would explain any such benefit. Time-restricted feeding does not significantly affect &lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0?__s=ovzgowspzgzjrjm83r95&quot;&gt;resting energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot;&gt;total daily energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;, and effects have been either neutral or slightly unfavorable (from the perspective of attenuating metabolic adaptation) with regards to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121099/&quot;&gt;leptin, ghrelin, insulin,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0?__s=ovzgowspzgzjrjm83r95&quot;&gt;thyroid hormone, and testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645638/&quot;&gt;Stote et al&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it is possible that time-restricted feeding may modestly impact body composition by increasing the efflux of free fatty acids from fat cells and increasing gluconeogenesis, but this doesn’t mesh very well with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29754952&quot;&gt;most tightly controlled study&lt;/a&gt; finding minimal evidence of a change in total daily energy expenditure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0?__s=ovzgowspzgzjrjm83r95&quot;&gt;Moro et al&lt;/a&gt; propose that the modest fat mass reduction observed could be linked to increased adiponectin levels, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645638/&quot;&gt;Stote et al&lt;/a&gt; exerted comparatively more dietary control and observed modest fat loss with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121099/&quot;&gt;absolutely no change in adiponectin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, evidence suggests no benefit to &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; meal frequency, at least when it comes to fat loss or energy expenditure. So, there’s no need to perpetually carry around six Tupperware containers to continuously stoke the metabolic furnace. While the time-restricted feeding data is less conclusive, it’s safe to say that time-restricted feeding has the capacity to help lower caloric intake when calories are not matched. When they are matched, time-restricted feeding is as effective as standard feeding for weight loss, with some studies suggesting a minor benefit. However, the minor benefit seems to shrink in studies that implement increasingly tighter control of energy balance, and time-restricted feeding inherently foregoes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/&quot;&gt;benefits of equally spaced protein feedings&lt;/a&gt; on protein turnover in muscle tissue (Figure 7). To be fair, the previously cited studies that have measured lean mass do not support the idea that more lean mass is lost during time-restricted feeding. There are, however, two important caveats to consider. First, these studies typically measure fat-free mass, not muscle; as such, broad measurements of fat-free mass may not directly reflect the protein balance of skeletal muscle. Second, the likelihood of substantial muscle loss is almost certainly higher in highly trained individuals attempting to get very lean than in the samples studied to date. Such a population tends to carry more muscle tissue, employ a larger caloric deficit, induce more substantial alterations in anabolic and catabolic hormones, and approach essential body fat levels to a greater extent than the general population, or even a recreationally trained population. For less extreme instances of weight loss, I am of the opinion that time-restricted feeding can be a valuable strategy for people who prefer to eat fewer, larger meals and enjoy the psychological benefit of forgetting about food during long fasting periods. However, early in my bodybuilding career, I implemented this strategy myself during contest preparation. While it fit my schedule and eating preferences quite well at the time, I suspect that a more even meal distribution would have better preserved muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image4-e1553621368289.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;muscle protein synthesis &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating the energy deficit within a week or a month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather that shifting meal times within a day, some studies have investigated the effects of shifting the &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; in which calories are consumed. These protocols often encourage people to have anywhere from 1-4 “fasting” days per week in which they either consume a mere 25% of their normal energy intake, or skip out on eating altogether. In the research world, this is known as intermittent fasting or intermittent energy restriction (&lt;em&gt;note the terminology discrepancy: the fitness industry often uses “intermittent fasting” to describe time-restricted feeding, while the research world uses “intermittent fasting” to describe the implementation of one or more weekly fasting days).&lt;/em&gt; In comparison to time-restricted feeding, many studies have investigated the weight loss effects of intermittent energy restriction. As displayed in Figure 8, there are a few types of protocols for intermittent energy restriction; the most common include alternate day fasting, fasting for a two-day period, or including two fasts per week on non-consecutive days. Multiple meta-analyses have investigated the efficacy of these interventions in comparison to normal, continuous energy restriction, all with slightly different inclusion criteria and analytical approaches. All &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29419624&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924195/&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; meta-analyses have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6304782/&quot;&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; that intermittent energy restriction strategies, using a variety of fasting protocols, do not lead to greater weight loss. However, they also don’t seem to be substantially worse (at least in untrained subjects). While I maintain concerns about lean mass retention when using prolonged fasting periods during fairly extreme dieting, intermittent fasting strategies that implement short (16-20 hours) or long (24+ hours) fasting windows can be effectively used by dieters who prefer the way these protocols fit their daily schedule or satiety preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image7-e1553621414784.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Popular intermittent energy restriction protocols &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of “refeeds” offer yet another option for manipulating energy intake throughout the week. A refeed involves acutely increasing caloric intake, usually by specifically increasing carbohydrate intake, and usually for no more than a day or two at a time. Research has shown that this approach is commonly used by competitive physique athletes, either through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5969027/&quot;&gt;structured refeeds&lt;/a&gt; or unstructured “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769537/&quot;&gt;cheat meals&lt;/a&gt;.” The purported benefits of refeeds are multifaceted; by acutely increasing carbohydrate (and energy) intake, one could potentially boost leptin and thyroid hormone levels, acutely increase energy expenditure, enhance muscle and liver glycogen content, and provide a welcome reprieve from the low-carb food menu that often accompanies contest preparation, particularly in the later stages. There is absolutely evidence supporting acute effects of refeeding on hormones and energy expenditure; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that a three-day carbohydrate refeed, but not a fat refeed, increased leptin by 28% and total daily energy expenditure by 7%. However, there is a big problem regarding the applicability of this protocol: it requires three days of 40% overfeeding, so that 7% increase in energy expenditure is entirely overshadowed by a huge caloric surplus. Viewed purely as a weight loss strategy, this is taking one step forward and several steps backward. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422530&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on physique athletes observed a marked increase in resting energy expenditure when comparing values measured shortly before competition to values obtained shortly after, which coincided with an increase in food intake. Again, this marked increase in energy expenditure was nowhere near enough to compensate for the increase in calorie intake required to induce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to more practical approaches to refeeding, Bill Campbell’s lab from the University of South Florida has published &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-018-0256-5&quot;&gt;a couple of abstracts&lt;/a&gt; from a seven-week study that provide some useful data. The study imposed a 25% calorie deficit for a group of resistance-trained individuals; one group had the same caloric intake every day, while the other had two consecutive, high-carbohydrate refeed days. In order to accommodate this two-day increase in energy intake, the deficit imposed on the other five days of the week was increased to ensure that both groups had the same overall energy deficit. Results from the abstracts should be taken with a grain of salt; abstracts are not reviewed as rigorously as full manuscripts, and the primary analysis for each abstract found no group by time interactions. However, some follow-up pairwise comparisons suggested that refeeding may have conferred &lt;em&gt;slight&lt;/em&gt; benefits when it comes to maintenance of resting metabolic rate and the retention of fat-free mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that longer durations of increased calorie intake may impart more protective effects, and a few studies shed light on this possibility. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826770&quot;&gt;eight-week study&lt;/a&gt; compared standard continuous energy restriction with an intermittent protocol that had subjects alternate between one week of energy restriction and one week of unrestricted eating. The groups lost somewhat similar amounts of weight over the eight weeks (3.2kg in the continuous group versus 2.0kg in the intermittent group). While the weight loss difference between groups was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; statistically significant (favoring the continuous group), the continuous group spent twice as much time in an energy deficit; as such, the intermittent protocol offered fairly similar rewards, but at a lower overall cost to the dieter enjoying breaks every other week. A separate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018593/&quot;&gt;six-week study&lt;/a&gt; compared a standard weight loss diet to a nonlinear approach, in which participants repeated two-week cycles of a 45% calorie reduction for 11 straight days followed by three days of self-selected eating. In the standard diet condition, participants simply reduced their caloric intake by 55% and ate this amount every day. After the six-week weight loss phase, there was a four-week follow-up period in which subjects ate around maintenance calories. In this study, the group with three-day “refeeds” kept their resting energy expenditure a little bit higher than the other group, and lost a little more weight (expressed as a percentage of weight lost), despite averaging higher daily caloric intake throughout the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5803575/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the effects of even longer diet breaks, with the intermittent group alternating between two weeks of dieting and two weeks of eating at &lt;em&gt;maintenance.&lt;/em&gt; That’s a really important distinction; the other studies just allowed subjects to self-select food intake during their “break,” whereas this study carefully fed them enough to reach, but not exceed, maintenance calories. Comparatively speaking, this study implemented the highest degree of control. Calorie intakes were consistently updated based on serial measurements of metabolic rate, and meals were cooked and provided by dietitians associated with the study. In order to make a more fair comparison of the diets, the intermittent group dieted for 30 weeks, while the continuous group dieted for 16; this way, the breaks were incorporated, but both groups spent 16 weeks in the same caloric deficit. Results showed that the intermittent group lost significantly more fat (12.3kg versus 8.0kg). Reductions in resting energy expenditure were similar in absolute terms, but the groups clearly had divergent changes in body composition. After adjusting for fat mass and fat-free mass, the continuous group experienced a significantly larger drop in resting energy expenditure than the intermittent group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even longer diet breaks have been implemented in the literature. For example, a 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951044/&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; implemented a five-month intervention in which subjects consumed 1,200 Calories for a week, 1,500 Calories for three weeks, 2,200 Calories for four weeks, then repeated the cycle. By the end of month five, participants had lost an average of almost 5kg, while avoiding significant reductions in resting energy expenditure. This study did not have a comparator group undergoing continuous weight loss, but it does offer an extreme example of the dilemma we face with the concept of refeeds or diet breaks. Refeeds and diet breaks appear to have the capacity to attenuate metabolic adaptation to some extent, but they also dramatically extend the timeline of the diet. As a result, there is a cost-to-benefit ratio that must be considered when determining the frequency and duration of refeeds or diet breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re keeping your caloric intake within a reasonable range (i.e., not dramatically overeating), a once-weekly refeed probably isn’t going to be enough to make a meaningful effect. If you implement four refeeds per week, you’re &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; not on a diet, from a mathematical perspective, and it’s hard to make your weekly caloric deficit large enough to promote substantial weight loss. To keep fat loss progressing forward &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; attenuate metabolic adaptation, two refeeds per week is probably the number most people should aim for. Refeeds should absolutely &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9084976&quot;&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; carbohydrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336&quot;&gt;intake&lt;/a&gt;, and caloric intake should be increased to right around maintenance level. Some argue that these refeeds should be placed on consecutive days, to allow a longer duration of time to physiologically “adjust” to being out of a deficit. Others argue that refeeds should be staggered throughout the week; they contend that metabolic adaptations are exacerbated by spending several days in a row in an energy deficit. A large portion of the leptin drop observed with weight loss occurs in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9771856&quot;&gt;first week&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9084976&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a huge fall in leptin occurs during the first four days of energy restriction, followed by a much slower decline over the following 24 days. By providing a refeed every three or four days, you could potentially provide a timely pulse of energy balance to keep metabolic adaptation at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can’t really say either approach is definitely wrong. I lean toward consecutive refeeds rather than splitting them up for a few reasons. From a theoretical perspective, we have operationalized metabolic adaptation as a coordinated response to prevent starvation. It’s hard to imagine that a single meal (or a couple meals) would convince our hypothalamus that, despite our prolonged confrontation with starvation, our circumstances have completely changed, such that we would rapidly override one of our most important survival responses. If we draw inferences from some tangentially relevant data, alternate-day fasting can be used to assess the effects of short but frequent refeeds. In rats, alternating between one day of fasting and one day of eating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12676282&quot;&gt;increased leptin&lt;/a&gt;, which had favorable effects on weight control and food intake compared to control rats. However, these results are confounded by the fact that one human day equals about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733029/&quot;&gt;34 rat days&lt;/a&gt;, from a biological perspective. In humans, one alternate-day fasting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24215592&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the intervention did cause weight loss, but reduced leptin by 40%. Another trial compared alternate-day fasting to a “normal” weight loss group; over the eight-week intervention, both groups had similar reductions in weight, leptin, and resting metabolic rate. It’s also important to note that the rise in leptin after consuming a meal is not immediate; according to one study, it’s not until about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012&quot;&gt;fifth hour&lt;/a&gt; after a meal that leptin levels appreciably rise, and they continue to rise thereafter. Studies generally show that leptin reductions from short-term energy restriction can be restored within about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10902800&quot;&gt;12-24 hours&lt;/a&gt; of refeeding, but leptin levels also&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10902800&quot;&gt; begin falling&lt;/a&gt; again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8784108&quot;&gt;within hours&lt;/a&gt; of the return to energy restriction. This is coupled with the facts that leptin clearance is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737404/&quot;&gt;especially rapid&lt;/a&gt; in lean people, and that many of the downstream benefits we hope to obtain from a leptin spike require multiple-step processes that take some time to play out. With a one-day refeed, I question exactly how much of an opportunity we would have to physiologically capitalize from any observed alteration in leptin. Finally, and most importantly, I’ve actually &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-018-0256-5&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; with two-day refeeds done in lean, resistance-trained people, and it produced modest but favorable results. Once one decides to implement refeeds on consecutive days, the lines between refeeds and diet breaks become blurred. How much time is sufficient? Two days? A week? Two weeks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of contextual factors that determine how refeeds or diet breaks are &lt;em&gt;most effectively&lt;/em&gt; used, but it’d be intellectually lazy to leave the answer at, “it depends.” For general weight loss that is intended to be permanent, a two-week diet break could be very doable, and the results from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925405&quot;&gt;MATADOR study implementing this technique&lt;/a&gt; are quite strong. A bodybuilder that is ahead of schedule, or willing to dedicate to a more prolonged contest prep period, can probably commit to a one-week break implemented every 3-4 weeks, or implemented as needed. If you’re an early-career bodybuilder with plenty of room to grow before you reach your genetic potential for muscularity, you’ll have to carefully consider how much of your year you’d like to spend cutting; while a seasoned pro near their genetic limit ought to take their time, an amateur with plenty of mass to gain should probably avoid &lt;em&gt;excessively&lt;/em&gt; long preps. If you’re behind schedule and unable to accommodate weeklong pauses, more frequent two-day refeeds might be the preferred option. If you’re more interested in some of the “other” benefits of refeeding (such as a brief psychological break, flexibility with high-carbohydrate foods, or glycogen replenishment prior to a particularly important training bout), a refeed every 3-4 days could make sense for you. Each type of refeed or diet break is a slightly different tool with slightly different pros and cons. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6196972/&quot;&gt;published protocol&lt;/a&gt;, we should have some more relevant research at some point in the near future. Until then, we’re left with a few conclusions: refeeds and diet breaks are viable tools to help attenuate metabolic adaptation, the benefit of attenuating metabolic adaptation comes with the cost of extending the total duration of weight loss, and the “ideal” manipulation of deficit days and maintenance days isn’t fully understood at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dropping Protein&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond strategies to target the root causes of metabolic adaptation, we have opportunities to alter our dietary intakes to manage some of the secondary effects resulting from metabolic adaptation. Calories must be reduced for the diet to promote weight loss, but there are unique drawbacks associated with lowering intakes of each individual macronutrient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evaluating the success of a weight loss diet, the two primary outcomes of interest are: 1) how much weight has been lost, and 2) how much of the weight lost was actually fat mass. In a short-term study (one week) back in 1988, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3182156&quot;&gt;Walberg et al&lt;/a&gt; compared isocaloric diets with 0.8 g/kg/day or 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. While the study was almost certainly too short to detect meaningful body composition differences using underwater weighing, the nitrogen balance analysis revealed that the lower protein group was is negative nitrogen balance, with the higher protein group in positive nitrogen balance. These changes in nitrogen balance are consistent with reduced breakdown of lean tissues in the high protein group. More recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19927027&quot;&gt;Mettler et al&lt;/a&gt; followed up with a slightly longer study, in which 20 resistance-trained athletes were randomly assigned to a high-protein weight loss diet (2.3 g/kg/day of protein) or a control weight loss diet (1.0 g/kg/day of protein) for two weeks. At first glance, the control diet seemed to be favorable, as they lost more weight during the brief weight loss diet. However, a closer look would reveal that fat loss was virtually identical between the two groups, and the difference in weight loss was due to a significantly greater loss of lean mass in the control group. Eric Helms published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092765&quot;&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; on the role of protein intake during energy restriction in resistance trained (and lean) athletes; in line with the findings of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3182156&quot;&gt;Walberg et al&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19927027&quot;&gt;Mettler et al&lt;/a&gt;, the collective body of evidence suggests that protein intake must be prioritized for the retention of lean mass under these circumstances. As noted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18469287?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; by Paddon-Jones et al, protein also carries some additional fringe benefits with it. Compared to carbohydrate and fat, protein features a substantially larger thermic effect of feeding and induces greater feelings of satiety on a calorie-for-calorie basis. As Helms points out in his protein review, there is a high likelihood that protein needs are not just important, but actually &lt;em&gt;higher than normal&lt;/em&gt; when lean, resistance-trained individuals are engaged in weight loss. While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28642676&quot;&gt;typical protein intake recommendations&lt;/a&gt; are around 1.4-2.0 g/kg/day, this fails to account for hypocaloric conditions, and inherently assumes a fairly “typical” body fat level. For these reasons, Helms scales &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092765&quot;&gt;his recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to kilograms of fat-free mass and recommends daily protein intakes of 2.3-3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass during energy restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dropping Fat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in sex hormone levels may be a contributing factor to the loss of lean mass during weight loss. Beyond weight loss, these sex hormones certainly contribute to the unpleasant reproductive side effects of extreme weight loss, and it would be fantastic to attenuate sex hormone reductions if possible. Over the years, several studies have identified a link between dietary fat intake and sex hormone levels. For example, reducing dietary fat intake from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6538617&quot;&gt;40% of calories to 25%&lt;/a&gt; for six weeks led to significant reductions in total testosterone and free testosterone in healthy men. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3558725&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; using male subjects instructed them to consume a diet including 100 g/day of fat for two weeks, followed by a drop to less than 20 g/day for two more weeks. This drastic drop in fat intake resulted in a combination of increased sex hormone-binding globulin and reduced free testosterone, and both changes are associated with a reduction in the biological activity of testosterone. In male strength athletes, dietary fat intake has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15532008&quot;&gt;been correlated with&lt;/a&gt; both resting testosterone levels and the post-exercise testosterone response to heavy resistance exercise. Further, the link between dietary fat and sex hormones is not restricted to men. An intensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9218745&quot;&gt;two-year trial&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the effects of reducing dietary fat to 15% of calories in premenopausal women; results showed that women assigned to the low-fat diet ended the trial with significantly lower levels of estradiol and progesterone and 7% higher (but not significantly different) levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, which plays a role in the regulation of estradiol production and the menstrual cycle. Just as low-fat diets appear to have a suppressive effect on male testosterone, this finding would suggest that analogous changes occur in women, with suppressed female sex hormone levels that could potentially interfere with menstrual cycle regularity and reproductive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, dietary fat intake is only one of the factors influencing sex hormone levels, and it’s almost certainly not the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; factor. Long-term caloric restriction itself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3569090/&quot;&gt;has been associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower sex hormone levels in males, in a manner that did not appear to be attributable to age, body fat percentage, or the proportion of calories from dietary fat. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133106/&quot;&gt;Research in anorexic females&lt;/a&gt; has shown that, even among anorexic patients who generally have low BMI and chronically restrict energy intake, body fat percentage seems to be an important independent predictor of developing menstrual cycle dysfunction and of eventually recovering from menstrual cycle dysfunction after it has occurred. This is coupled with the observations that low testosterone is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; consistently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133106/&quot;&gt;observed in males with anorexia&lt;/a&gt; and in published male bodybuilding case studies, despite the wide range of potential dietary tactics that could be employed to reach such low levels of body fat. In addition, testosterone recovery in bodybuilding case studies often takes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;several months&lt;/a&gt;, with recovery &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;coinciding more closely&lt;/a&gt; with the restoration of body fat levels than increases in dietary fat intake. Taken together, the available evidence suggests that sex hormones are reduced to some extent by caloric restriction and extreme leanness, which are inherently unavoidable when the goal is to get really lean. So, while it is prudent to avoid &lt;em&gt;exacerbating&lt;/em&gt; the downregulation of sex hormones by excessive reduction of dietary fat, your chances of manipulating fat intake to completely abolish drops in sex hormones are slim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dropping Carbohydrate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some downsides to reducing carbohydrate intake. A few published observations in bodybuilders lend some evidence for the role of carbohydrates in supporting bodybuilding success. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769537/&quot;&gt;observational study&lt;/a&gt; in natural bodybuilders previously noted that more successful competitors tended to report higher carbohydrate intakes at the beginning of preparation compared to less successful competitors. The primary limitation here, aside from the observational study design, is that carbohydrate intakes were only significantly different at the start of the diet, but not the end. Theoretically, if the plan was to identify nutrition strategies that facilitate a successful contest prep, the dietary differences toward the middle and/or end of the diet would be more informative than those at the start. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300017&quot;&gt;Maestu et al&lt;/a&gt; observed that individuals who had the largest insulin reductions throughout contest prep also tended to lose the most lean mass. Given the robust insulin release observed in response to carbohydrate intake, one might infer that a higher carbohydrate intake would help preserve lean tissue during a weight loss diet. However, it is important to note that dietary protein can also be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9356547&quot;&gt;quite insulinemic&lt;/a&gt;, and insulin levels &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; correlated with the loss of fat mass in this study. So, it is possible that the people who lost less fat mass had higher insulin levels and retained more lean mass because they simply didn’t get as lean as the other competitors in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond these cloudy instances of indirect evidence, there are more controlled studies that show some direct disadvantages of slashing carbs from the diet. Whether we are resting or sprinting, we rely on a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005844/&quot;&gt;three energy systems&lt;/a&gt; to supply the ATP required. At rest, the rate of ATP demand is pretty low, so the aerobic energy system is able to provide ample ATP, primarily by breaking down fat. As we begin to engage in activities of higher relative intensity, the contributions of the anaerobic (phosphagen and glycolytic) energy systems &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3588899/&quot;&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt;. This is important because the glycolytic energy system makes a very substantial contribution to fueling resistance exercise, and by definition this energy system relies on carbohydrate as the substrate for ATP synthesis. As such, it should be no surprise that studies have shown carbohydrate restriction to impair resistance exercise performance. One &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/abstract/1999/02000/effects_of_carbohydrate_restriction_on_strength.10.aspx&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; put participants through a glycogen-depleting workout, had them restrict carbohydrate (1.2 g/kg/day) intake for 48 hours, then assessed resistance exercise performance. For the three-set squat protocol at 80% of the one-rep maximum load, carbohydrate restriction caused participants to perform significantly fewer repetitions during sets one and two. In addition, the previous study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3182156&quot;&gt;Walberg et al&lt;/a&gt; showed that high protein diets maintained positive protein balance, but protein was kept high by reducing carbohydrate intake. An unintended consequence was that, despite favorable effects on protein balance, the high protein/low carbohydrate group had a reduction in quadriceps muscle endurance compared to the group with lower protein and higher carbohydrate intake. These applied performance outcomes are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784189/&quot;&gt;supported &lt;/a&gt;by well-controlled &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; studies investigating the link between carbohydrate and muscle force production. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a calcium-storing structure found within muscle cells, and the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a critical step mediating a muscle fiber’s ability to produce force. In instances when carbohydrate intake is insufficient to replace muscle glycogen use, the glycogen stores adjacent to the sarcoplasmic reticulum become depleted. Several studies have shown that this results in lower calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to more rapid muscle fatigue and earlier reductions in force production. As such, strategically utilizing carbohydrate intake to attenuate the magnitude of muscle glycogen depletion during energy restriction can be viewed as a preferred dietary strategy to preserve performance in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Striking a Balance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we’ve reviewed the evidence suggesting that your weight loss diet should be high in protein, high in fat, and high in carbohydrates in order to maintain muscle, attenuate metabolic adaptation and related side effects, and support performance in the gym. Good luck trying to make that work while successfully losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve acknowledged that perfection is out the window, the discussion shifts to making this puzzle work as best we can. Sufficient protein intake is simply non-negotiable, and recommendations suggest this should be set around 2.3-3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass, which is often up around 2 g/kg of total body mass or higher (depending on how lean you are). Once protein is set, it’s important to set a “basement value” for fat, or a level of fat intake you simply are not willing to go below. This is a bit of a balancing act; we need to remove calories from &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, and fat calories are a viable option for removal. However, going too low with fat will likely exacerbate reductions in sex hormones during weight loss, and we need enough fat to obtain sufficient essential fatty acids, promote the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and keep the diet reasonably palatable. For most individuals, fat intakes really shouldn’t drop below around 0.6-0.7 g/kg of total body mass per day. Once these minimums are set for protein and fat, the rest of your calories are going to come from some mixture of carbohydrate and fat; in the interest of performance, I prefer for the majority to come from carbohydrate. These macronutrient boundaries have little chance of &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; attenuating adaptive thermogenesis, hormone fluctuations, performance decrements, or the loss of lean mass. They’re just the best we can do with what evolution gave us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-cardio-for-successful-weight-loss&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Cardio For Successful Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#managing-cardio-for-successful-weight-loss&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is dictated by creating an energy deficit, and energy intake is only half of the equation. Weight loss diets are typically paired with increases in cardiovascular exercise, and the inclusion of cardio is almost always part of the approach for physique athletes. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of adding cardio to a resistance training program. In some instances, the additional cardio blunts adaptations to resistance exercise, which is known as the &lt;em&gt;interference effect&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., the cardio &lt;em&gt;interferes&lt;/em&gt; with adaptations to the resistance training program). In short, the root of this interference is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728927&quot;&gt;attributed to&lt;/a&gt; the stimulation of conflicting cell signaling events that underpin training adaptations to strength and endurance training, and additional fatigue induced by additive endurance exercise. Under normal circumstances, the interference effect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12627304&quot;&gt;impacts power outcomes&lt;/a&gt; more than it impacts strength, and impacts strength more than it impacts hypertrophy. However, a number of contextual factors dictate the likelihood of observing a substantial interference effect. Most notably, as one might expect, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728927&quot;&gt;more cardio seems to equate to more interference&lt;/a&gt;. Studies implementing two or fewer sessions of cardio per week have generally failed to observe substantial interference, whereas studies implementing three or more sessions of cardio per week often observe statistically significant impairment of resistance training adaptations. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine if it is the frequency or volume of cardio that is driving these outcomes, as high-frequency cardio programs also tend to be higher in volume in the studies published to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For physique athletes, the combined load of resistance training and cardio is at the high end of this frequency/volume discussion toward the end of contest prep. In case studies we have documented, it’s fairly typical for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;male&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;female&lt;/a&gt; competitors to add up to five or six cardio sessions per week, on top of an independently demanding 5-6 day per week resistance training program. In addition, these athletes are fighting an uphill battle in terms of hormones. As discussed in Part 1, weight loss attempts in lean individuals are often accompanied by decreases in testosterone and increases in cortisol. For years, the testosterone to cortisol (T:C) ratio &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5640004/&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; as an imperfect, but informative, marker of overtraining and impaired recovery. Even in normal-weight athletes with unrestricted caloric intake, excessive training loads often drive the T:C ratio downward to a level that is associated with an unfavorable “anabolic-catabolic balance.” The recovery of physique athletes is also threatened by insufficient energy intake to maintain body weight (which is unavoidable) and commonly observed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;issues obtaining quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; (which is pretty hard to fix). Taken together, the circumstances surrounding weight loss, particularly in more extreme cases like physique athlete contest preparation, present conditions in which the likelihood of an interference effect is increased. Moreover, careless implementation of excessive cardio has great potential to exacerbate some of the unfavorable effects observed with metabolic adaptation, especially those linked to fatigue and hormone fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid exacerbating some of these issues, cardio should be thoughtfully and carefully implemented as part of the weight loss plan. Unfortunately we have to make some very broad observations and some tenuous conclusions when viewing the concurrent training literature, because there is an immense variety of factors that can fluctuate within a single study design. For example, I might want to make an inference about how the intensity of cardio affects strength in the next resistance training bout. A study might shed some insight on this question, but there will inevitably be confounding factors to consider (such as the modality of cardio, duration of the overall bouts, frequency, overall training loads of both resistance training and cardio components within the study, training status of subjects, sex of subjects, duration of the study, and the time elapsed between cardio and strength testing, just to name a few). Whenever you change one factor in this type of study, there tends to be a ripple effect that requires alteration to some other factor(s). Nonetheless, a review by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728927&quot;&gt;Fyfe et al&lt;/a&gt; helps to consolidate some of the information currently available from concurrent training studies, and some general recommendations can be made for people who wish to be cautious with their cardio implementation. Certainly the overall load of training must be managed, and dieters should err on the side of doing as little cardio as they can get away with while still supporting fat loss (and general cardiovascular health, if that’s important to you). There are also temporal considerations; following endurance exercise, force production of the trained musculature is typically impaired for at least six hours. The evidence would suggest that the most prudent approach would be to perform cardio and resistance training on separate days, if possible. When cardio and resistance training must be performed in the same session, it would be preferable to prioritize resistance training first, which seems to be as effective or slightly more effective for attenuating interference than performing resistance training after cardio (we’re talking about the actual bout of cardio here, not a quick warm-up to get moving before lifting). When it comes to intensity, things are a bit complicated; high-intensity bouts cut down on the overall duration of cardio, but really intense bouts call for a level of physiological arousal that can be quite exhausting and may induce more residual neuromuscular fatigue. Looking at the literature, it also appears that running is associated with more interference than cycling, which may relate to less muscle damage, less residual neuromuscular fatigue, or less robust stimulation of interfering molecular pathways with cycling exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’d be shortsighted to make cardio-related decisions without first considering the preferences of the dieter. While a physique athlete should never aim to exclusively run their way to contest shape, physique athletes can succeed within a wide range of cardio implementation strategies, and the restrictions on non-physique athletes are even less restrictive. Some people hate cardio, and that shouldn’t be ignored. Dieting for weight loss is already unpleasant enough, even when done well; the cumulative psychological burden of spending several hours per week doing something you dread should not be overlooked, as weight loss success is contingent on both psychology and physiology. While I’m personally pretty neutral about cardio in terms of enjoyment, it tends to markedly increase my hunger. While this doesn’t happen to everybody, I’m also not alone; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3696411/&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that there is a great deal of variability with respect to hunger and other compensatory responses to cardio. Conversely, some people quite enjoy cardio (I think — I’ve never met one, but I’ve been assured they exist). If that is the case, and they aren’t exacerbating their hunger or aggravating injuries in the process, then reasonable amounts of cardio should absolutely be used as part of the plan to promote an energy deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-factors-to-consider&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other factors to consider&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#other-factors-to-consider&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to attenuating the effects of metabolic adaptation, the most influential factors under our control have been covered in previous sections (rate of weight loss, refeeds and diet breaks, macronutrient intakes, and management of cardio). There are a few other factors that are a little harder to manage or that make a slightly smaller impact but deserve acknowledgement nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;sleep-and-stress&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and stress&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#sleep-and-stress&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is important for anyone with strength- or physique-related ambitions. Aside from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/&quot;&gt;negative effects of sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; on cognition, mood state, and general physical performance, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8112265&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that three days of partial sleep restriction impairs bench press, leg press, and deadlift strength. While there is a surprising lack of sleep research in the area of resistance training &lt;em&gt;recovery&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a safe assumption that sleep is an important component. As a fairly obvious, surface-level observation, lack of sleep seems to impair readiness to train and interfere with voluntary effort. Sleep restriction also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19955752&quot;&gt;metabolic and hormonal effects&lt;/a&gt; that can exacerbate aspects of metabolic adaptation. Insufficient sleep impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, while increasing cortisol and ghrelin levels, decreasing leptin, and increasing hunger and appetite. Sleep restriction also shifts food preferences toward more calorie-dense, hedonically rewarding options, thereby threatening dietary adherence. Sleep-induced increases in cortisol have been observed in conjunction with reductions in testosterone and IGF-1, prompting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21550729&quot;&gt;researchers to speculate&lt;/a&gt; that insufficient sleep may be linked with muscle loss and impaired muscle recovery. In support of these mechanistic findings, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921542&quot;&gt;small crossover study&lt;/a&gt; found that individuals lost less fat mass and more fat-free mass during caloric restriction when they slept 5.5 hours per night compared to 8.5 hours per night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, sleep is rarely discussed in the bodybuilding literature. One of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;case studies&lt;/a&gt; evaluated sleep, both using objective and subjective assessments. While the accelerometer-based objective measurement showed no meaningful change, subjective assessments showed that sleep quality suffered toward the end of contest preparation. It’s possible that the accelerometer simply wasn’t equipped to accommodate the fact that bodybuilders in contest prep constrain their non-exercise movement to a statue-level degree of stillness. The subjective reduction in perceived sleep quality supports widely reported anecdotes of sleep issues during the later phases of contest prep; even as sleep becomes harder to obtain in more extreme weight loss attempts, an earnest effort should be made to obtain it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/&quot;&gt;Strategies to help&lt;/a&gt; promote sleep quality include limiting blue light exposure within 1-3 hours of intended sleep onset and limiting the intake of stimulants with long half-lives (such as caffeine) late in the afternoon and evening. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/#CR45&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that diets relatively high in protein and carbohydrate, with low or moderate fat intake, support high quality sleep, as does consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal in the evening and avoidance of going to sleep while hungry. Unfortunately, these are luxuries that might not be feasible on a more intense weight loss diet. More practically speaking, a handful of supplements (including melatonin, tryptophan, valerian, and magnesium) are purported to have beneficial effects on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also prudent to discuss the effect of stress in the context of metabolic adaptation, as stress, sleep, and metabolism are all inter-related. Stress can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538178/&quot;&gt;induce sleep loss&lt;/a&gt;, sleep deprivation can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964364/&quot;&gt;increase subjective stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and both subjective stress and sleep deprivation can influence metabolism. The effects of stress are primarily dictated by cortisol, with downstream effects on testosterone, leptin, ghrelin, appetite, and a shift toward more hedonic and calorically dense food preferences. Excessive stress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538178/&quot;&gt;yields outcomes quite similar to sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt;, and the two often go hand-in-hand. Unfortunately, stress can sometimes be hard to avoid during a fairly intense weight loss phase (or life in general), especially if the stress of an impending competition is involved. Aside from general stress management techniques, the most direct approaches to mitigate excessive stress during weight loss include prioritizing effective sleep habits, allowing a flexible timeline for your weight loss goal, and avoiding diet and exercise strategies that cause stress because you hate doing them so much. Adaptogen supplements, such as rhodiola rosea and ashwagandha, may also play a role in attenuating the effects of high stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;supplements&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#supplements&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to practical strategies for attenuating metabolic adaptation, I would be remiss to neglect the potential applications of supplements altogether. However, I broach the subject with great trepidation, as I’ll explain shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are indeed some supplements and/or over-the-counter drugs that promote energy expenditure and fat loss, such as ephedrine, p-synephrine (bitter orange), yohimbine, caffeine, nicotine, and capsaicin. Each one comes with drawbacks. Ephedrine is banned in many countries, including the United States, due to the receipt of several severe adverse event notifications. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5655712/&quot;&gt;P-synephrine&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a less potent version of ephedrine; its side effects are less potent, but so are its effects on energy expenditure. Until more research on p-synephrine becomes available, I’m not entirely convinced that its effects are meaningful enough to support its use. Yohimbine is known to cause anxiety symptoms in many people, interacts with several drugs, has some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391406&quot;&gt;quality control issues&lt;/a&gt; with regard to dosing in products, and ought to be used in conjunction with fasted cardio (which I rarely recommend) to maximize its benefit. Caffeine’s effect on metabolic rate is fairly modest, and it’s quite easy to go “overboard” with caffeine intake as you start becoming habituated to its effects. It’s not uncommon to hear about dieting individuals that are taking in pretty hefty caffeine doses daily (sometimes over 1,000mg per day), and unsurprisingly experiencing restlessness, anxiety, headaches, or insomnia as a result. Nicotine is quite addictive, and it seems a bit unethical to 1) advocate the off-label use of a drug for unintended purposes, such as a weight loss aid, and 2) advocate the use of an addictive substance that, despite having a far more favorable safety profile than tobacco, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946180/&quot;&gt;may still have independent adverse health effects&lt;/a&gt; of its own. Finally, there is capsaicin, the extracted component that gives cayenne and chili powder their “kick,” and capsiate, a less pungent analog of capsaicin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257466/&quot;&gt;Research does suggest&lt;/a&gt; that these chili pepper components increase metabolic rate, especially at higher doses (135-150mg capsaicin or 6-9mg dihydrocapsiate), in a reasonably safe manner. However, the magnitude of this effect is fairly modest, and by no means a miracle strategy for keeping metabolic adaptation at bay. There is also emerging evidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30624591&quot;&gt;ephedrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421122/&quot;&gt;several dietary components&lt;/a&gt; (including capsaicin, resveratrol, curcumin, green tea, berberine, fish oil, conjugated linoleic acid, and all-trans retinoic acid) may activate brown adipose tissue and/or promote the “browning” of adipose tissue, a process by which white fat cells begin behaving more like brown fat cells by increasing uncoupled thermogenesis. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421122/&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; for such an effect is quite preliminary and largely derived from non-human research models. So, aside from a morning or pre-workout caffeine boost and generous servings of cayenne powder on some meals, I do not advocate (or implement) any supplement strategies specifically for the purpose of maintaining energy expenditure during weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the supplements suggested to promote energy expenditure are also purported to attenuate hunger. In addition, some non-thermogenic supplements are thought to suppress appetite or promote satiety, such as ginger, 5-HTP, caralluma fimbriata, and alpha-lipoic acid, among others. For each, high-quality evidence in human subjects is fairly limited. Aside from the use of supplements, there are some very practical dietary strategies to promote satiety and mitigate hunger. Examples include selecting foods with relatively high &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498104&quot;&gt;satiety index&lt;/a&gt; values, eating high-volume foods with low caloric density, drinking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118565&quot;&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt; with meals, and consuming conventional foods with generous amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10743483&quot;&gt;red pepper&lt;/a&gt;. While there are some supplements and strategies that may have minor effects on appetite, I generally advise against the premise of aggressively “hiding from hunger” during more extreme weight loss attempts. With small, sustainable weight loss attempts, you may never actually reach a point of substantial hunger. If preparing for a physique competition, hunger will be a reality, and it’s probably best (from a psychological viewpoint) to just embrace that. When you try to plan your whole day around avoiding the threat of hunger, it gives hunger way too much power over your subjective well-being. Hunger is, after all, a natural and appropriate response to the restrictions you’re imposing, so it is remarkably difficult to override and there is no reason to fret over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion-2&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic adaptation is going to happen, but there are some very practical strategies to help attenuate its effects. Daily protein should generally be set at no less than 2 g/kg of total body mass, and up as high as 2.3-3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass, when in a sizable caloric deficit. Fat intake typically shouldn’t go below 0.6-0.7g/kg of total body mass as a bare minimum value, and dieters should make an effort to prioritize carbohydrate with whatever calories they have left over. Slower rates of weight loss should be preferred; especially for fairly lean individuals, the rate of weight loss should rarely exceed 1% of body weight per week. In the interest of lean mass retention, recovery, and maintenance of sanity, reasonable volumes and frequencies of cardio training should be used to promote an energy deficit. Refeeds and diet breaks may provide additional protections against the effects of metabolic adaptation. Refeeds should be implemented 2-3 times per week, and you can make a reasonably strong (but not indisputable) argument that these should be situated consecutively. When the diet timeline allows, these refeeds could be taken a step further with the implementation of periodic diet breaks, lasting one to two weeks in duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a perfectly suitable plan if you aren’t banking on surviving past the end of your weight loss phase. For whatever reason, that’s about as far as most people plan. Fortunately, for the overwhelming majority of dieters, life goes on after you reach your weight loss goal. Much like puberty, it’s a chaotic time; your body is changing, hormones are fluctuating wildly, and it can be a bit stressful if you haven’t been given a warning about what to expect. Part 3 is that warning and offers some strategies to plan for a less chaotic transition to life after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For short-term dieting, just about everything works. For long-term dieting, almost nothing works. There are 8-12 week studies showing successful weight loss with just about every approach in the book, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16002825&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673773/&quot;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; that only about 10-20% of individuals are able to maintain substantial weight loss in the long term. If you are dieting to a sustainable body weight and you intend to maintain a large percentage of your weight loss, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19045969&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; generally suggests that maintaining high levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801984&quot;&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and frequent monitoring of body weight are important strategies to promote weight loss maintenance. Even with these strategies, weight loss maintenance proves to be a very challenging endeavor. If you’re only planning to hold your weight loss for a short amount of time (such as dieting for a weight-based athletic event, a photo shoot, or a physique competition), then weight regain is expected. However, since we know weight regain is coming, it should be done intentionally, in a well-planned and thoughtful manner. Understanding the weight regain literature facilitates the formulation of such a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwhelming success rates with long-term weight loss have prompted researchers to consider the possibility that metabolic adaptation may persist beyond active weight loss, and into the weight maintenance (or weight regain) period. One small but tightly controlled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842775&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; sought to determine if energy expenditure remained suppressed during weight loss maintenance. In order to assess this research question, they measured total, resting, and non-resting energy expenditure in three types of people: 1) people at their normal body weight, 2) people who had maintained a 10% body weight reduction for the previous 5-8 weeks, and 3) people who had maintained a 10% body weight reduction for the previous 1-6 years. Even after adjusting for relevant confounding variables, both weight loss groups appeared to have total, resting, and non-resting energy expenditure values that were lower than predicted. When compared to the normal weight group, both weight loss groups had significantly lower total and non-resting energy expenditure values, with no significant difference between recent and sustained weight loss groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989512/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; assessed participants from the Biggest Loser competition six years after achieving dramatic weight loss. Participants had originally lost an average of 58.3kg, and had gained back 41.0kg by the six-year follow-up study. Resting metabolic rate was 704 Calories below baseline, which is 499 Calories lower than predicted. In this study, the degree of resting metabolic rate suppression was correlated with the degree of weight loss that had been maintained, meaning that individuals who maintained more weight loss displayed a greater degree of adaptive thermogenesis. The propensity for weight regain after weight loss is not a coincidental trend; as reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174765/&quot;&gt;MacLean et al&lt;/a&gt;, many of the aspects of metabolic adaptation that oppose active weight loss also predispose us to weight regain, especially if we lost a ton of weight or got &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; lean. As these two studies have shown, some aspects of metabolic adaptation can even persist for years after active weight loss. In the time period immediately following weight loss, we have a body with less metabolically active tissue, emptier adipocytes, more energetically efficient tissues, less leptin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-7&quot;&gt;lower levels of thermogenic, anorexigenic, and anabolic hormones, and higher levels of orexigenic and catabolic hormones&lt;/a&gt;. It is a body primed for ravenous eating and precipitous fat gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;body-fat-overshooting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Fat Overshooting&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#body-fat-overshooting&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This predisposition to rapid fat gain can be a bit problematic if we allow it to go completely unchecked. Our adipocytes (fat cells) get smaller when we lose weight, with a negligible change in the number of total adipocytes. As previously discussed, a huge ramification of reduced adipocyte size is that the adipocyte produces less leptin, which drives metabolic adaptation forward. Even beyond leptin, a thorough &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371661/&quot;&gt;review by MacLean et al&lt;/a&gt; describes numerous ways in which the physiology of adipocytes changes in response to weight loss. Adipocyte gene expression changes, shifting toward a gene expression profile that downregulates energy expenditure, increases appetite, and promotes the storage of nutrients. Smaller (i.e., emptier) adipocytes react to insulin differently; they take up more glucose in response to insulin stimulation, and are less sensitive to insulin-induced suppression of lipid breakdown. They also tend to have lower levels of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which are critical for lipid breakdown. Changes in extracellular matrix structure, sympathetic tone, and circulating thyroid hormone may be underlying many of the changes in the metabolic characteristics of adipocytes, ultimately yielding a physiological environment in which fat storage is promoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While weight loss doesn’t alter the number of adipocytes, rapid weight regain might. Ideally, any weight regain would just refill the existing adipocytes, but the altered metabolic environment following weight loss may promote the addition of new fat cells, known as adipocyte &lt;em&gt;hyperplasia&lt;/em&gt; (Figure 9). This effect has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18287221&quot;&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; in overfed rats; while it still requires additional research to demonstrate its relevance to humans, it could be but one of many factors contributing to fat regain after weight loss. As noted in a review by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654501&quot;&gt;Peos et al&lt;/a&gt;, this would be particularly disadvantageous for athletes that complete several weight loss cycles across a career. Addition of new adipocytes increases the overall capacity for fat storage, and allows fat to be stored while the original adipocytes have yet to be fully replenished with energy. In the short-term, this could increase the likelihood that individuals not only regain the fat they lost, but actually gain &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fat than they lost. In the long-term, this could yield even more adipocytes with the potential to convey their relative “emptiness” during the next weight loss attempt, potentially amplifying some of the physiological signals that promote metabolic adaptation and oppose weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image5-e1553621499791.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;adipocyte hyperplasia during weight regain following energy restriction &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic rodent data are fascinating, but only if they pan out in humans. While we don’t have much direct evidence of adipocyte hyperplasia in re-fed humans, we do have some intriguing observations of loosely related outcomes. An interesting observation in studies evaluating weight regain is that the early regain phase is characterized by selective storage of fat, with minimal restoration of fat-free mass. This effect, known as post-starvation obesity, has been observed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614201&quot;&gt;several previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, including the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11010936&quot;&gt;Biosphere study&lt;/a&gt; from Part 1 of this article. This could be related to adipocyte hyperplasia to some degree, but the more prominent driver appears to be the loss of fat-free mass while dieting (Figure 10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image3-e1553621644414.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;loss of fat-free mass while dieting –&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained in a paper by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5945583/&quot;&gt;Dulloo et al&lt;/a&gt;, adaptive suppression of metabolic rate is most closely linked to the existence of an energy deficit and the loss of fat mass; in contrast, hyperphagia is linked most closely to reductions in fat mass and fat-free mass. With weight regain, the energy deficit is eliminated immediately, and fat mass is restored fairly promptly. However, the restoration of fat-free mass takes longer, and it is common for fat mass to be entirely restored to pre-diet levels before fat-free mass is fully restored (for a visualization of this effect using arbitrary numbers, see Figure 11). In this scenario, hyperphagia continues in order to complete the restoration of fat-free mass, and the dieter actually regains more fat than they initially lost. This is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614201&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;fat overshooting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and may be driving the results of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16568134&quot;&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt; reporting that athletes who engaged in repeated cycles of weight loss and weight regain tend to have higher BMIs later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-e1553621693747.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;setting the stage for fat overshooting &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not adipocyte hyperplasia is an important contributing mechanism in humans, the available human research indicates that the physiological environment following weight loss favors weight gain, fat is preferentially regained in the initial phase of weight regain, restoration of fat-free mass is a comparatively slower process, and it is not uncommon to regain more fat than was initially lost. For physique athletes (or strength/power athletes dieting to fairly low body weights), this has some important implications for managing the post-diet period. First, it suggests that the old-school idea of being “primed for muscle growth,” or banking on some rebound effect of rapid muscle gain after a weight loss diet, is mythical and unsubstantiated. We ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422530&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, and results showed quite clearly that the initial, immediate post-show weight gain is largely attributable to increased water weight, and the additional weight gained in the first 4-6 weeks was almost entirely fat mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, all of this evidence presents a dilemma for planning the post-diet phase for physique athletes (or other dieters completing fairly intense weight loss phases). Certainly, reversing the unfavorable effects of metabolic adaptation is high on the priority list, which both improves quality of life and sets the stage for progress toward continued strength and/or hypertrophy goals. That process is going to require some additional calories. However, it’s safe to assume that someone who just completed an arduous fat loss phase would prefer to avoid immediately gaining all of it (or more) back. This is difficult, because we are physiologically primed for fat gain after this type of weight loss, and the added calories in the initial post-diet period appear to be preferentially diverted toward fat cells for storage. In order to promote recovery while attenuating excessive fat gain, two primary approaches for controlled refeeding have emerged: reverse dieting and recovery dieting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reverse-dieting-versus-recovery-dieting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Dieting Versus Recovery Dieting&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#reverse-dieting-versus-recovery-dieting&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; my co-authors and I were the first researchers to actually acknowledge the term “reverse dieting” in a peer-reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-7&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, but we certainly didn’t coin the term. So, let me begin by giving credit where credit is due. I first heard the term “reverse dieting” attributed to Layne Norton; he definitely popularized the term, but neither he nor I know exactly where it was first used. Based on some digging, it appears that the term “recovery dieting” is attributable to Jeff Alberts and the 3D Muscle Journey crew. These could be misattributions, and I apologize if they are, but I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t really search the research literature for an agreed-upon definition for these terms, so I’m going to present some operational definitions that reflect my personal conceptualization of each term (&lt;em&gt;note: these are my interpretations, so I am not putting words in the mouth of the individuals who coined these terms&lt;/em&gt;). The general premise with reverse dieting is that calories, mainly from carbohydrate and fat, are incrementally added back to the diet after the weight loss goal has been achieved. As the calories slowly increase, the dieter transitions from a deficit to maintenance to a surplus in a controlled and methodical manner. As calories are increased in a gradual, stepwise fashion, metabolic adaptations are reversed over the course of this process. As a result, energy expenditure increases as caloric intake is increased, which prevents rapid fat accumulation out of the gate. Theoretically, this would allow the dieter to begin their offseason with substantially higher caloric intake than during their weight loss phase, but with a fairly low level of body fat. Recovery dieting is quite similar, with somewhat minor differences in the implementation. It seems as if recovery dieting was essentially introduced in response to excessively slow implementations of reverse dieting; as a result, recovery diets often include a very deliberate jump to a small caloric surplus immediately after the weight loss phase ends, and the approach generally allows a quicker rise in caloric intake and more directly embraces reasonable levels (and rates) of fat regain early in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t see much value in pitting these approaches against each other to determine which is best. Frankly, I struggle to see “reverse diet versus recovery diet” as anything but a false dichotomy. Both approaches seek to address the dilemma of promoting recovery while mitigating excessive fat storage and weight regain. If we were to construct a Venn diagram, these terms would have a lot more overlap than exclusivity. There might be subtle differences with regard to how quickly calories are added, but there are plenty of factors to consider when determining how much weight should be regained, and how quickly. I will certainly acknowledge that a &lt;em&gt;really slow&lt;/em&gt; reverse diet could theoretically leave the dieter in a slight caloric deficit for weeks after the intended end of the weight loss diet; this would serve only to delay even the most basic and immediate aspects of recovery, and make their life unnecessarily difficult. Furthermore, an attempt to stay &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; lean during the offseason would likely inhibit an individual’s ability to fully restore normal hormone levels, reverse the hyperphagia induced from dieting, and make strength and hypertrophy gains in the offseason. It’s also relevant to note that a very slow, very strict reverse diet is unequivocally more challenging and psychologically draining than the most brutal of contest preps. How do you reasonably convince yourself to exercise that level of dietary restraint when it defies all of your physiological cues, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you don’t intend to step on stage for another 24 months?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These theoretical shortcomings exist, so the ideas reinforced by the emergence of recovery dieting are helpful and valid. Some might say that, by acknowledging the potential shortcomings of an extremely slow reverse diet, I have a preference for recovery dieting by default. However, I don’t believe that the concept of reverse dieting necessarily &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; such an extreme approach, and I’m not sure how many people are actually willing and able to implement this type of protocol after achieving stage-ready levels of body fat. Frankly, I think both approaches serve to reinforce some very important principles for how to approach the diet after weight loss has occurred. So, rather than construct extreme examples of each approach and have them battle it out, I would much prefer to outline some principles for the post-diet period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your diet is over, get the hell out of a deficit, immediately. Beyond that point, any time spent in a deficit is wasted recovery time. If that puts me in the “anti-reverse-dieting” camp, then so be it. Based on this reasoning, I don’t really see a lot of utility in using nonlinear approaches like refeeds or diet breaks; every day should be a surplus, to some degree. If you want some extra special HUGE surplus days to accommodate your eating preferences, and that’s why you’re using a nonlinear approach to calorie distribution, go for it, as long as the “low calorie” days keep you at or above maintenance calories. If you are planning to increase calories slowly enough to create a super-charged metabolic rate, don’t bother. The premise of fabricating a new metabolic rate from scratch is implausible. We only have the capacity to restore a transiently suppressed level of energy expenditure, and we have two primary tools to use: more calories, and more time spent in a surplus. There are certainly instances in which people slowly raise calories and manage to reach fairly high caloric intakes while staying lean, but there are explanations for this that do not require wizardry as an assumption. In the initial stages of slow overfeeding, they are simply fixing an impairment. Their metabolic rate is lower than it should be at the start, and they restore it to its normal level (and, for some people, “normal” is higher than others). After the impairment of energy expenditure is restored, there is also the potential for the opposite effect to occur; in response to overfeeding, some people dramatically increase their non-exercise activity thermogenesis to &lt;em&gt;prevent weight gain&lt;/em&gt;. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880251&quot;&gt;great deal of variability&lt;/a&gt; between people for this response; as you might imagine, individuals prone to weight gain typically have a very minor increase in NEAT when they are overfed, while individuals resistant to weight gain display large increases. Furthermore, the individuals who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; able to slowly work toward high caloric intakes while maintaining almost-stage-ready body composition are still fairly miserable and unrecovered, for the most part. From a very basic viewpoint, recovery can be viewed in three stages: elimination of the calorie deficit, restoration of reasonably sufficient fat mass levels, and restoration of lean mass. Someone who clings to competition-level body fat is unlikely to achieve fully comprehensive recovery from the multifaceted barrage of metabolic adaptation, and unlikely to reach a high enough body fat level (or energy surplus) to support substantial hypertrophy and strength improvements in the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you’re planning to rapidly overfeed to capitalize on a quick rebound of muscle gain, don’t bother. As previously discussed, the body is effectively primed for fat accretion, but lean mass gains are hard to come by in this scenario. To optimize the ratio of weight that is regained as lean mass (within a realistic range), the best bet is to get the body into a caloric surplus, nudge the body toward recovery with incremental caloric increases that promote positive energy balance and fat mass restoration at a conservative pace, while engaging in a challenging and progressive resistance training program. Rapid fat gain would probably expedite the recovery process, but would come at the cost of an elevated ratio of fat gain to lean tissue gain and an increased likelihood of fat overshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the deficit should be eliminated immediately, and caloric intake should be gradually increased. Exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; quickly calories should be increased depends on who you are and where you’re at in your career. If you have plenty of muscle to gain before you reach your genetic limit for muscle mass, you should probably consider pushing the pace (within reason). If you’ve got several years of training under your belt and believe you’re close to your genetic ceiling for muscle mass, it probably makes more sense to stay leaner and take it a bit slower (assuming you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to stay lean and don’t feel terrible at your desired body fat level). For the vast majority of lifters who have some more muscle to gain before they max out their muscular potential, fat gain should not be avoided. In fact, it should be intentionally restored to a level that allows for recovery of the endocrine system and substantial hypertrophy to occur in the offseason. This just needs to happen over a time course that could reasonably be expected to attenuate adipocyte hyperplasia, prevent fat overshooting, and allow for lean tissue restoration to occur alongside fat tissue restoration (rather than rapid and excessive fat gain, followed by slow lean tissue accretion). You could probably find enough wiggle room in the definitions of “reverse dieting” and “recovery dieting” to make this approach fit either, if you felt so inclined. A summary describing &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the factors pertaining to how quickly or slowly to increase calories is presented in Figure 12. But how fast is too fast, and how slow is too slow? That question can’t be answered without considering how long recovery is expected to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image6.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;increasing calories: fast vs slow &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-does-recovery-take%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long Does Recovery Take?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#how-long-does-recovery-take%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to say how long it takes to recover from a diet. First of all, we need to determine what “recovery” entails. During the recovery period, we observe a reversal of adaptations related to energy expenditure, hormone levels, physical performance, reproductive function, sleep habits, and appetite, among others. The reality is that recovery is multifaceted, and different components of recovery appear to follow distinct time courses. To make things even more difficult, our behaviors and general approach to recovery make a huge impact on how quickly recovery occurs. During the recovery period, we deal with a ton of factors that are free to vary; some are under direct volitional control (resistance training load, cardio training load, energy intake, macronutrient distribution, sleep hygiene), while others are not (life stressors, heritable predispositions, psychological factors, sleep quality). When asked about the timeline for recovery, it’s tempting to say “it depends” and move on. But we might as well make some observations of the literature and do our best with interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the case studies, we see a wide range of timelines for weight recovery; some physique athletes return to their baseline weight by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;nine weeks&lt;/a&gt; post-competition, while others are still below baseline weight a full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;six months&lt;/a&gt; after. On that topic, weight overshooting has been observed by 5-8 months post-competition, with both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;male&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27879627&quot;&gt;female&lt;/a&gt; competitors ending up a couple of kilograms heavier than they started. While the subject described by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;Rossow et al&lt;/a&gt; did not fully return to his initial bodyweight six months post-competition, he also had not yet restored his fat-free mass to baseline levels. Generally speaking, hormones more closely associated with short-term energy availability (such as ghrelin, thyroid hormone, insulin, and cortisol) start to show pretty substantial recovery in the first 3-4 months. Leptin and male testosterone levels seem to take longer; case studies measuring up to 5-6 months after competition have failed to document full &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;leptin&lt;/a&gt; recovery in males. Generally speaking, these 3-6 month hormone recovery timelines seem to fit pretty well with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222856/&quot;&gt;most relevant study&lt;/a&gt; featuring a reasonably large sample. In this study of female physique athletes, 27 dieters were compared to 23 controls throughout approximately 5 months of dieting and 4 months of recovery, give or take. By the end of recovery, body composition had almost fully returned to baseline levels, and most hormones were still a little below normal, but moving in the direction of full recovery. Performance recovery seems to vary quite a bit; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412685&quot;&gt;Rossow et al&lt;/a&gt; described complete recovery of deadlift and squat performance within four months, but bench press remained below baseline after six months. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28770669&quot;&gt;Pardue et al&lt;/a&gt; reported that absolute Wingate sprint performance, assessed as both peak and average power, had increased but not fully recovered five months after competition. Using squat dynamometry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;Tinsley et al&lt;/a&gt; showed that peak force production was modestly suppressed nine weeks after competition, but the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of force production remained substantially below baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While menstrual cycle disruption is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5222856/&quot;&gt;very common&lt;/a&gt; observation during preparation for physique competitions, its restoration after competition appears to be highly variable. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30036283&quot;&gt;one case study&lt;/a&gt;, the participant returned to normal body weight by nine weeks post-competition, and menses resumed approximately three months after competition. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27879627&quot;&gt;different case study&lt;/a&gt;, energy availability surpassed 35 Calories per kg of fat-free mass at 10 weeks post-competition, and body weight and fat mass had been restored by week 20; nonetheless, it took a full 71 weeks of recovery for menses to resume. Regulation of the menstrual cycle is affected by a wide range of inputs, and restoration can take quite a while for many women. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-21&quot;&gt;three-month&lt;/a&gt; dietary intervention successfully managed to increase energy intake and energy availability in female athletes with menstrual irregularity, but the intervention was ineffective at actually restoring regular menstruation. Other diet and exercise interventions aimed at restoring normal menstrual function have reported resumption of menses around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10200061/&quot;&gt;2-3 months&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8653102/&quot;&gt;6-7 months&lt;/a&gt; after the onset of intervention. Finally, a nine-month intervention was carried out in 21 dancers and 31 athletes with menstrual disorders. After nine months, regular menses was restored in only 14.3% of the dancers and 22.6% of the athletes, and the authors speculated that the “average” time required for restoration might be upwards of a full calendar year for this sample. In this sample, restoration of menses was less likely in subjects who began the intervention with lower levels of body fat and lower energy availability; the authors speculate that increasing fat mass was a particularly important factor for resumption of regular menses. Variable recovery times are even observed in more intensive approaches; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080974/&quot;&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; using exogenous leptin injections found that menstruation was restored in seven out of ten subjects, with menstruation appearing 4-32 weeks following the onset of leptin therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, different aspects of recovery occur over different timelines. Total energy expenditure can be partially restored in response to short-term overfeeding, but full restoration of energy expenditure seems to take longer. As positive energy balance is maintained and fat mass is restored over the first 3-6 months, hormones, energy expenditure, and performance outcomes tend to start reverting back toward baseline levels. There is a great deal of variability in recovery timelines between individuals, especially when it comes to restoring menstrual cycle irregularities. Variability is certainly related, at least in part, to how the post-diet period is approached. Recovery is likely to be accelerated in the context of a larger energy surplus, more expeditious restoration of fat mass and lean mass, more &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; restoration of fat mass and lean mass, more conservative management of training loads, and more effective management of sleep and life stressors. As such, more rapid increases in caloric intake after dieting favor more rapid and complete recovery, but must be weighed against the increased likelihood of body fat overshooting. A final aspect of recovery, which may take even longer than the physiological aspects, involves psychological recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;psychological-aspects-after-weight-loss&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Aspects After Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#psychological-aspects-after-weight-loss&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as psychology plays an important role in weight loss, it also plays an important role in the period immediately following weight loss. The transition from dieting to maintenance or weight regain can involve shifts in motivation, perspective, habits, and body image. For this topic, I will focus on people who are dieting to unsustainable levels of leanness, such as preparation for a physique competition or photo shoot. If you’re in this position, we can make two reasonably safe assumptions: 1) you will experience noticeable fat gain in the weeks and months following weight loss, and 2) your physique is at least &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; important to you. These types of fat loss endeavors often predispose the dieter to some rituals that probably have more negative psychological ramifications than we’d like. For example, a ton of physique athletes adhere to a morning routine in which they wake up, check their body weight for the day, and take a look in the mirror. A favorable weigh-in and a subjective improvement in the mirror can really set the tone for a positive morning during contest prep, and results from the morning weigh-in are often internalized dichotomously as “good” or “bad” progress. Luckily, an effective contest prep virtually assures incremental improvements over time, so it’s a trend over several months that has a lot more good than bad. But what happens when weigh-ins are consistently higher each day, and the mirror assessment reveals incrementally more fat? If the mind is entrained to perceive a lower weight and a leaner appearance as a “good” morning check-in, this sets the dieter up for several months of “bad” mornings. Coupled with the usual weight gain stressors (such as ever-tightening belts and clothing, a newfound accumulation of abdominal fat that becomes apparent when you sit down, or noticing that your glutes are actually covered with adipose tissue when you sit on a hard chair or bench), this can set the dieter up for a rough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early weight regain phase can be associated with body image issues, a variety of disordered or problematic eating habits, reduced motivation, and the general negative affect that physique athletes call the &lt;em&gt;post-competition blues&lt;/em&gt;. Having a plan for the period after weight loss also involves a psychological component. I’m no psychologist, so take this with a grain of salt, but it intuitively seems remarkably ill-advised to leave this component entirely unaddressed. The perspective for what constitutes a “good” check-in and a “bad” check-in should be either drastically revised, or thrown out altogether. Positive post-competition progress for a super-lean physique athlete doesn’t just &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; for some fat regain, it &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; it. There is tremendous benefit to embracing the positive aspects of weight regain: it’s promoting recovery of your endocrine system, it’s making you feel better on a day-to-day basis, it’s restoring your energy level, it’s giving you more dietary flexibility, it’s fueling &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; better training in the gym, and it is an instance of successfully implementing the post-competition plan. This shift in perspective has to be intentional and approached in a proactive manner, primarily to ensure that post-diet weight gain doesn’t psychologically and emotionally hit you like a ton of bricks. When psychological recovery is not proactively planned for, it can sometimes take up to 12-18 months to truly feel “normal” after a rigorous weight loss diet. When the challenges and stressors that accompany the period after weight loss are anticipated and planned for, this timeline can be dramatically shortened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion-3&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you finish a weight loss diet, many of the unfavorable effects of metabolic adaptation are in full swing, and your body is primed for fat regain. If you’ve dieted to a reasonably sustainable body fat percentage, maintenance is certainly achievable. If you’ve dieted to a physique competition-level body fat percentage, weight regain is an important part of recovering from the unfavorable metabolic and hormonal effects of metabolic adaptation. However, if there’s no plan in place for transitioning from weight loss to either maintenance or a controlled weight regain process, the likelihood of excessive fat regain and body fat overshooting is increased. When the weight loss phase ends, calories should promptly be raised to maintenance levels, at minimum. Prolonging the energy deficit serves only to inhibit recovery, but the “ideal” rate at which caloric intake should increase depends on the goals and circumstances of the individual. For individuals who are comfortable returning to their initial body weight, metabolic, hormonal, and performance-related adaptations should be largely reversed within 4-6 months. Other aspects of recovery, such as restored menstrual regularity and psychological recovery, are much more variable between individuals. More conservative approaches to the post-diet recovery process that seek to delay or minimize fat regain have the potential to substantially prolong the recovery timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#summary&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight loss attempts are met with changes in mitochondrial function, hormone levels, and energy expenditure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These changes produce some unpleasant side effects, threaten our ability to gain (or even keep) muscle mass and strength, manipulate biological cues pertaining to the regulation of appetite and activity level, and require us to eat even fewer calories and/or incorporate even more cardio into our training program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To mitigate the effects of metabolic adaptation, dieters should avoid rapid weight loss (&amp;gt;1% of body mass per week), eat sufficient protein (2.3-3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass), and avoid excessive cardio volumes and frequencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refeeds (twice weekly) and diet breaks (1-2 weeks at a time) may also help to attenuate the effects of metabolic adaptation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid body fat overshooting and promote recovery, it’s important to have a transition plan in place for when the weight loss diet ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caloric deficit should not extend beyond the period of intended weight loss; the rate at which calories should be increased depends on the goals and circumstances of the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For competitors that return to (or near) their initial body weight, most physiological parameters tend to recover within 4-6 months, while menstrual cycle regularity and psychological factors are far more variable and often take longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conservative approaches that raise calories more slowly may minimize fat regain, but may also extend the timeline for full recovery.&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>The “Hypertrophy Rep Range” – Fact or Fiction?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you%E2%80%99re-getting-yourself-into%3A&quot;&gt;What you’re getting yourself into: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-you%E2%80%99re-getting-yourself-into%3A&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3500 words, 12-25 minute read time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information about the individual studies, adjustments, and analyses can be found in the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;The “Hypertrophy Rep Range” – Stats and Adjustments&lt;/a&gt; if you want to dig a little deeper into this topic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key Points &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-points&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When looking at the whole body of scientific literature, there’s simply not a very big difference in muscle growth when comparing different rep ranges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;From a practical standpoint, you should probably do most of your training in the rep range that allows you to get in the most hard sets per training session and per week for each exercise you use and each muscle you train.  This generally coincides with a moderate intensity and rep range for most exercises and most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since different rep ranges go about triggering a growth response in slightly different ways, you’re probably better off training with a full spectrum of rep ranges instead of rigidly staying in a single rep range and intensity zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction-to-the-hypertrophy-rep-range&quot;&gt;Introduction to the Hypertrophy Rep Range &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#introduction-to-the-hypertrophy-rep-range&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been training now for a decade.  In that time, I’ve seen a lot of ideas, fads, and trends come and go.  One standby, though, has been “rep ranges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least as far back as the ’50s (and probably before), people have been promoting the idea that low reps were ideal for strength development, moderate reps (somewhere between 6-8 reps on the low end, and 12 to 15 on the high end) were best for building muscle, and high reps were best for building strength endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How fanatical people were about those rep ranges varied, sure, but those have been the accepted ranges for a long, long time.  Some people take it to the extreme, and assume that any muscle growth outside of the “hypertrophy range” will be minimal or nonexistent.  Other people will assent to the idea that you can still grow a bit with low-rep or high-rep training, but that your results will still be notably better if you stick to the “hypertrophy range.”  Sure, you may be able to build a little muscle doing heavy sets of 3 or 20+ rep “pump sets,” but you’d grow more if you stayed in the hypertrophy range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before jumping in, I will note that the assumptions about lower reps/higher weights building more strength and higher rep/lower weights building more strength endurance &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; largely been validated.  You can still gain strength with light weights/high reps and moderate weight/moderate reps, but strength gains &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; generally better with heavy, low-rep training.  Conversely, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; build absolute muscular endurance (how many times you can move a set load, regardless of your 1rm) with low rep and moderate rep training, but you can build a lot more with high rep training, and high rep training is generally the only way to improve relative muscular endurance (how many times you can lift a certain percentage of your 1rm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to do in this article is examine that middle zone:  the “hypertrophy range.”  Is training in that general range the best way to build muscle?  &lt;em&gt;Can you expect more muscle growth training in that range, and if so, just how big are the differences?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just to define terms before we get underway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I talk about “heavy” or “low-rep” training, I’m generally talking about loads in excess of 85% of your 1rm, for sets of 5 reps or fewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I talk about “moderate weights,” “moderate reps,” or “the hypertrophy zone,” I’m generally talking about loads between 60-85% of your 1rm, for sets of 6-15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I talk about “light weights” or “high reps,” I’m generally talking about loads less than 60% of your 1rm, for sets of 15 reps or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanistic-perspective&quot;&gt;Mechanistic Perspective &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#mechanistic-perspective&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask ourselves the million-dollar question before diving in:  What the heck makes a muscle grow in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we can look at it from a mechanistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847704&quot;&gt;major mechanisms of hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt; in a constant tug of war are mechanical tension and metabolic stress.  More of one generally means less of the other.  When you add weight to the bar, you induce more tension – but you can’t do as many reps, so metabolic stress is lower.  When you take weight off the bar, you can cause more metabolic stress – but muscle tension is lower.  Looking at things from this very basic perspective, you’d expect training to be effective across a pretty broad range of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you’re a savvy reader, you may want to check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;background information&lt;/a&gt; before reading this next section.  However, I know it would make some people’s eyes glaze over, so I made it a separate post.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-a-hypertrophy-range-scientifically%3F&quot;&gt;Is there a hypertrophy range scientifically? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#is-there-a-hypertrophy-range-scientifically%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe, but the overall picture is murky, and any differences would be pretty small.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparison-one%3A-the-%E2%80%98hypertrophy-range%E2%80%99-vs.-study-averages&quot;&gt;Comparison One:  The ‘Hypertrophy Range’ vs. Study Averages &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#comparison-one%3A-the-%E2%80%98hypertrophy-range%E2%80%99-vs.-study-averages&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These next two charts compare the average results of the groups training in the “hypertrophy range” of 6-15 reps per set to the average results of all the participants in the study.  Each positive data point means the average growth in the high- or low-rep group beat the average growth in the moderate rep group, and vice versa for negative data points.  All the studies included in this analysis are linked at the end of the article, and all adjustments made to the data in order to control for factors such as number of sets and rest intervals are explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using adjusted values, there was effectively no difference in this comparison.  Low reps out-performed the study means by 1% on average compared to moderate reps, and moderate reps out-performed the study means by 1% on average compared to high reps.  As you can see, though, most of the studies cluster in the +/- 20% range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using adjusted values, there were a few differences, but they were pretty small.  Low reps out-performed the study means by 7% on average compared to moderate reps, and moderate reps out-performed the study means by 8% on average compared to high reps.  As you can see, though, most of the studies still cluster in the +/- 20% range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 13 calculable effect sizes comparing low to moderate reps, three favored moderate reps, two favored low reps, and the other eight were ties (effect size differences &amp;lt;0.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average effect size in the low rep measurements was 0.68, and the average effect size in the moderate rep measurements was 0.71.  These average effect sizes were not significantly different (p = 0.37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 calculable effect sizes comparing high to moderate reps, nine favored moderate reps, three favored high reps, and the other four were ties (effect size differences &amp;lt;0.2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average effect size in the high rep measurements was 0.75, and the average effect size in the moderate rep measurements was 1.08.  There was a trend toward significance (p = 0.082).  However, this was strongly influenced by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00421-012-2339-3&quot;&gt;single study&lt;/a&gt; discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Excluding that one study, the average effect size was 0.85 for high reps and 0.99 for moderate reps, and the trend toward significance disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to point out (or reiterate, for people who read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;supplementary material&lt;/a&gt; already) before starting this section:  This comparison is probably the least appropriate set because muscle growth was measured in different ways in different studies.  However, I think it’s worth discussing because it adds another layer of analysis and another set of comparisons some readers will be more familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-16.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the nine studies or measurements comparing low reps (five or fewer reps per set, 85%+ 1rm) to moderate reps (6-15 reps per set, 60-85%1rm), three favored moderate reps, and three favored low reps, and there were three ties when looking at percent differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-27.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 14 studies or measurements comparing high reps (20 or more reps per set, &amp;lt;60% 1rm) to moderate reps (6-15 reps per set, 60-85%1rm), five favored moderate reps, and six favored high reps, and there were three ties when looking at percent differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pooling all the studies together, low reps caused measures of muscle size to increase by 11.91±5.70% on average.  Before adjusting for differences in sets and rest periods, moderate reps in those same studies caused measures of muscle size to increase by 10.63% on average.  After adjustments, moderate reps caused a 12.19±6.58% increase.  Neither of those increases were significantly different from those caused by low reps. (The p &lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt; 0.32 for unadjusted, and p = 0.46 for adjusted values; one-tailed t-test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-21.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pooling all the studies together, high reps caused measures of muscle size to increase by 9.17±5.10% on average.  Before adjusting for differences in sets and rest periods, moderate reps in those same studies caused measures of muscle size to increase by 12.00% on average.  After adjustments, moderate reps caused a 10.67±8.5% increase.  Neither of those increases were significantly different from those caused by high reps. (The p &lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt; 0.15 for unadjusted, and p = 0.32 for adjusted values; one-tailed t-test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-22.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I looked to see if there was a correlation between reps per set and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing low reps to moderate reps, there’s no relationship whatsoever:  r = 0.062.  Due to the variety of ways to measure muscle growth used in these studies and differing lengths of the studies, you wouldn’t expect a super strong correlation.  However, 0.062 is about what you’d expect from a completely random data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image-23.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing high reps to moderate reps, the correlation is effectively nonexistent as well:  r = -0.27.  Generally, a correlation of at least ±0.3 is required to classify something as even being a weak relationship.  Additionally, the r^2 value of 0.074 means that only about 7.4% of the differences in muscle growth can be explained by differences in rep range used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In all likelihood. But that doesn’t mean you should do all your training there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s time to take the scientist hat off and put the lifter/coach hat back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On average&lt;/em&gt;, looking at both percent differences and effect sizes, the “hypertrophy range” did slightly better than either high reps or low reps.  However, there were also plenty of instances where low reps or high reps had a small edge.  Finally, keep in mind that this sort of aerial-view analysis is looking at the averages of the average results of a bunch of different studies.  The studies’ results didn’t conform to a nice, tidy pattern, and you can bet that the individual results within those studies didn’t conform to nice, tidy patterns either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, here’s what I’m personally taking away from this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “hypertrophy range” of roughly 6-15 reps per set &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; produce &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; better results per unit of time invested than low rep and high rep work.  However, on the whole, the advantage you get from working in the hypertrophy range isn’t nearly as big as people seem to think; &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; a ~10-15% advantage per unit of effort invested at most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can absolutely grow effectively when training with low reps and high reps.  In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012033&quot;&gt;mechanistic work&lt;/a&gt; has shown that although different rep ranges trigger similar elevations in protein synthesis, the signaling pathways activated to produce that growth response are actually somewhat different.  You’re probably missing out on some growth if you confine yourself to a single rep range, even the “hypertrophy range.”  My assumption is that individual signaling pathways would habituate to a single stimulus faster than multiple signaling pathways would habituate to slightly different stimuli.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the sheer amount of variability we’re looking at, both within studies and between studies, it’s probably not wise to assume that a single rep range will be the best for everyone.  Some people and some exercises just seem to do better with higher reps or lower reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think instead of asking yourself, “Is this rep range better than this other rep range in some objective physiological sense?” you’re better off asking yourself, “What allows me to get in the most high quality sets during each session and during each week?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack that statement a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality sets refer to those that employ exercises that are likely going to be &lt;em&gt;limited by the muscle you’re trying to train&lt;/em&gt;, through the longest &lt;em&gt;range of motion&lt;/em&gt; you can maintain with safe form, taken &lt;em&gt;within 2-3 reps of failure*&lt;/em&gt;, and performed when you’re &lt;em&gt;adequately recovered&lt;/em&gt; from your previous set (generally around 1.5-2 minutes of rest for isolation lifts, and 3-5+ minutes for heavy compound lifts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Failure defined as absolute failure for exercises like curls or delt raises where injury risk is low, and technical failure for exercises like squats or deadlifts where injury risk is higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing hard sets within a training session depends, in large part, on what you’re accustomed to and how you respond to each set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, heavy sets of 3-5 reps will – for lack of a better term – “burn out their CNS” (that’s a big topic not worth unpacking right now), meaning that after a couple of challenging sets, they just feel fried and the rest of their workout suffers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For other people, sets of 12-15+ will just crush them metabolically, especially for exercises like squats and deadlifts, meaning they can’t get in much high quality work after a couple of hard sets.  Maximizing hard sets within a session is also why stopping 2-3 reps shy of failure – especially on heavy compound lifts – is generally a good idea; a set to failure generally takes more out of you than a set stopped a bit earlier and limits how much more quality work you can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing hard sets within a training week depends both on what you can best recover from between sessions and how you structure your training week.  Again, some people wind up with creaky joints if they lift too heavy, too often, and other people are left with crippling soreness when they train with higher reps (especially if they’re not used to them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structuring the training week is another topic for another day, but the basics are simple: If you’re training a muscle or movement twice per week, then you should try to make sure those sessions are spaced out by at least 72 hours.  If you’re training a muscle or movement more than twice per week, make sure that you’re the most well-rested going into your hardest sessions, and intersperse harder sessions with easier ones so that you’re not accumulating too much fatigue.  If training one lift hard is going to interfere with another lift (for example, squats and deadlifts), either try to do them in the same session so that you have time to recover before doing them again, or try to put as much time as possible between your hardest session for one and your hardest session for the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this question practically, I think &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is where the “hypertrophy rep range” really comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 6-15 rep range, the weights are generally manageable enough that you can maintain good technique, not cheat the range of motion, get pretty close to failure safely, not “burn out your CNS” after just a couple of sets, and not be left with creaky joints.  On the other hand, the weights are generally heavy enough that you’re still putting a fair amount of tension on the muscle, you’re more likely to be limited in each set by muscular fatigue than systemic anaerobic fatigue, and you’re not doing so many reps that you’re metabolically crushed after your first couple of sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, I think people have gotten the cause and effect mixed up:  It’s not that there’s something magical about the “hypertrophy range” that makes it meaningfully better than other intensity ranges when other training variables are controlled for. It’s that simply being able to do more hard training tends to produce better results, and most people tend to be able to do the most hard training when they do the majority of their work in that intensity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, your goal should be to find the rep range for each lift that allows you to get the most high-quality, hard work in.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=For%20hypertrophy%3A%20Find%20the%20rep%20range%20that%20allows%20you%20to%20get%20the%20most%20high-quality%2C%20hard%20work%20in.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;For hypertrophy: Find the rep range that allows you to get the most high-quality, hard work in. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=For%20hypertrophy%3A%20Find%20the%20rep%20range%20that%20allows%20you%20to%20get%20the%20most%20high-quality%2C%20hard%20work%20in.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking purely anecdotally, here are my 100% bro-certified, entirely not-evidence-based observations about the rep ranges that tend to work best for several key lifts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squats and deadlifts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 3-8 for people with a strength sports background.  You’re probably strong enough that more than 8 reps gets too metabolically taxing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 5-10 for newer lifters, or people with bodybuilding background.  It’s typically a bit lower for deadlifts than squats, because letting your technique slip as you fatigue is easier with deadlifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rows&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 8-15.  People often make the mistake of going too heavy and turning rows into a hip hinging exercise more so than a lat exercise.  While I have my bro hat on, cheaty rows are a pretty effective accessory lift for improving your deadlift, but don’t tend to be a great lat builder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull-ups/Chin-ups&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 5-10.  Pull-ups lend themselves to lower reps than rows because it’s harder to use momentum to cheat the movement.  Additionally, people tend to start compromising range of motion with higher reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbell pressing of all sorts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 5-10 tend to work best here.  Too heavy, too often tends to beat up people’s elbows and/or shoulders, and a lot of people find that higher rep sets seem to be limited more by their anterior deltoids than their pecs (bench or incline), lateral deltoids (overhead press), or triceps (all types of pressing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell pressing of all sorts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 8-15 in general.  With weights that are too heavy, balance can become problematic, so you waste a lot of energy just controlling the weight instead of training the muscles you’re trying to train.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unilateral lower body work&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 8-15 in general.  Again, the weight needs to be light enough that you can work the target muscles and train the movement effectively instead of turning the exercise into a balancing act, but they also need to be heavy enough that metabolic fatigue within the set isn’t going to start making balance problematic toward the end of the set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any sort of isolation lift or machine work&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets of 8+.  With isolation lifts, you don’t really have to worry about systemic metabolic fatigue, and going too heavy can irritate a lot of people’s tendons since generally you can work the individual muscle through a longer range of motion than you’d be able to with a compound lift.  Regarding machine work, low reps on machines just seems silly and anecdotally just doesn’t seem to work very well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, these are just general guidelines based on my own experiences and observations.  Start there, and experiment to see what lets &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; get in the most high-quality work.  Some people simply do better with higher or lower reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb: &lt;em&gt;Aim to get 60-70% of your work sets in the rep range that you personally find works best for you, and get 15-20% of your sets with heavier weights/lower reps and about 15-20% of your work with lighter weights/higher reps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=It%27s%20important%20to%20use%20rep%20ranges%20across%20the%20spectrum.%20Don%27t%20neglect%20lower%20and%20higher%20rep%20work.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;It&#39;s important to use rep ranges across the spectrum. Don&#39;t neglect lower and higher rep work. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=It%27s%20important%20to%20use%20rep%20ranges%20across%20the%20spectrum.%20Don%27t%20neglect%20lower%20and%20higher%20rep%20work.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re doing 15 sets per week of exercises focused on a particular muscle, that would mean getting 9-10 of those sets within your personal “hypertrophy range,” along with 2-3 heavier, lower rep sets and 2-3 lighter, higher rep sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to round out this section regarding practical application, keep in mind that this applies to &lt;em&gt;hypertrophy training&lt;/em&gt;.  The game is a little bit different for maximizing strength development in the short term, though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/powerlifters-should-train-more-like-bodybuilders/&quot;&gt;most strength athletes &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; benefit&lt;/a&gt; from focusing more on hypertrophy work during most of their training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to dig even deeper into this topic, read about the math and adjustments behind the graphs above, read a little bit about the individual studies that were included in this analysis, and see which studies were excluded with reasons for exclusion, you can do so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-stats-adjustments/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  At this point, though I’m going to wrap things up for this article since this is the end of the stuff 80% of you will probably care about.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=There%27s%20not%20a%20big%20difference%20in%20hypertrophy%20when%20comparing%20rep%20ranges%20in%20the%20literature.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;There&#39;s not a big difference in hypertrophy when comparing rep ranges in the literature. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.strongerbyscience.com%2F%3Fp%3D40789&amp;amp;text=There%27s%20not%20a%20big%20difference%20in%20hypertrophy%20when%20comparing%20rep%20ranges%20in%20the%20literature.&amp;amp;via=strengthry&amp;amp;related=strengthry&quot;&gt;Click To Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;edit%3A-september-2016&quot;&gt;Edit: September 2016 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#edit%3A-september-2016&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the original version of this article was published, three more studies have come out comparing the effects of training in different intensity ranges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first by Morton et. Al&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jap.physiology.org/content/early/2016/05/09/japplphysiol.00154.2016&quot;&gt;Neither Load Nor Systemic Hormones Resistance Training-Mediated Hypertrophy or Strength Gains is Resistance-Trained Young Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants were young men with some strength training experience (at least 2 years required, with an average of 4 years).  The participants all performed four full-body training sessions per week for 12 weeks.  One group did 3 sets of 8-12 reps for all exercises, and one group did 3 sets of 20-25 reps for all exercises.  All sets were taken to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences between groups in gains of fat- and bone-free mass, leg lean mass, appendicular lean mass, type I muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13451285_10207337304575713_996889718_n.png.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Type 1 and Type 2 fiber growth after training with 30-50% of 1rm vs. 75-90% of 1rm. As you can see, the results for both fiber types were darn near identical for both loading zones. Source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second by Fink et. Al&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-2333-z&quot;&gt;Impact of High Versus Low Fixed Loads and Non-Linear Training Loads on Muscle Hypertrophy, Strength, and Force Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants here were untrained.  The training protocol involved three sets of unilateral preacher curls to failure, three times per week (not exactly how most of us train, but certainly controlling for a ton of variables to allow for a valid comparison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group trained with 80% 1rm for sets of 8-12, one group trained with 30% 1rm for sets of 30-40, and one group alternated between training with 80% and 30% for two weeks before switching back to the other intensity range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elbow flexor (biceps and brachialis) muscle thickness increased by basically the same amount in all three groups – 9.1±6.4% with sets of 8-12, 9.4±5.3% with sets of 30-40, and 8.8±7.9% for the group alternating between sets of 8-12 and sets of 30-40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third by Schoenfeld et. Al&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0035-1569369&quot;&gt;Effects of Varied Versus Constant Loading Zones on Muscular Adaptations in Trained Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants had four years of training experience on average.  Half of them trained with sets of 8-12 reps for three sessions per week, while half of them trained with sets of 2-4 reps one day, sets of 8-12 one day, and sets of 20-30 one day.  Both groups did the same number of sets, and all sets were taken to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 8 weeks, growth was pretty comparable between the two groups.  Effect sizes slightly favored varied loading over constant loading for elbow flexor (biceps and triceps; .72 vs. .57) and triceps (.77 vs. .48) growth.  In terms of percentages, it was a 6.6% vs. 5% increase in cross-sectional area for the elbow flexors, and 6.4% vs. 4.2% for the triceps.  There wasn’t a meaningful difference in quad growth, however (effect size of 1.04 vs. 1.12, and a 7.6% vs. 8.6% in vastus lateralis cross-sectional area, &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; favoring constant loading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these differences reached formal statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Table-1-1024x216.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;From Schoenfeld et. Al. Source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three new studies largely confirm the previous analysis in the original version of this article.  All three equated volume based on number of sets to failure, and all three found very similar growth across a variety of rep ranges.  It’s interesting that Schoenfeld’s study found a slight benefit for changing loading zones, while Fink’s found that changing loading zones had essentially no effect (in fact, the group that changed loading zones got &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; worse results than the two groups that trained with either sets of 8-12 or sets of 30-40 consistently – the difference was nowhere close to significance).  The difference may have to do with how often the loading zones were varied: daily for Schoenfeld versus every two weeks for Fink.  That seems like an area in need of more research to tease out the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr – in the past 7 months, three new studies have been published that very much fall in line with the bulk of the previous literature and the analysis in the original version of this article:  As long as sets are taken to failure or near failure, muscle growth is very similar between all rep and intensity ranges.  There is no “hypertrophy zone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;edit%3A-september-2017&quot;&gt;Edit: September 2017 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#edit%3A-september-2017&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&amp;amp;issue=00000&amp;amp;article=95794&amp;amp;type=Abstract&quot;&gt;recently-published meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/ask-the-expert-interview-with-brad-schoenfeld-ph-d/&quot;&gt;Brad Schoenfeld&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues analyzed hypertrophy after low-load (&amp;lt;60% of 1RM) and high-load (≥60% of 1RM) training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest plot of results from the included studies is the real money shot here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screenshot-2017-09-24-18.32.08.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confidence interval for all effects crosses zero, and the pooled effect was 0.03 – that may be the smallest pooled effect I’ve ever seen in a meta-analysis.  The “difference” was, of course, non-significant, and didn’t even approach the 0.20 cutoff conventionally used to identify a “small” effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of this article, the vast majority of the studies in this meta compared what I’d consider low vs. moderate loads.  This is the absolute strongest evidence we have that hypertrophy is the same between moderate-load training (i.e. the “hypertrophy zone”) and low-load training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum%2C-may-2018&quot;&gt;Addendum, May 2018 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#addendum%2C-may-2018&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29564973&quot;&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; (reviewed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/mass/&quot;&gt;latest issue of MASS&lt;/a&gt;) had some findings that provide some important new information in this area of research.  In most of the studies comparing high-load and low-load training, the low-load group uses a weight between 30-50% of 1RM.  There have been a couple studies using really low loads (15.5% is popular, for some reason), but those studies generally do a pretty bad job equating protocols.  Typically, the high-load groups in those studies are training to failure or close to failure, and the low load group just does a ton of sets, not particularly close to failure.  This recent study gives us the first “fair” comparison between higher-load training and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; low-load training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the subjects did unilateral training (biceps curls and knee extensions).  One arm and leg trained with 20% of 1RM, and one arm and leg trained with either 40%, 60%, or 80% of 1RM.  The subjects did their three sets with 20% first, going to failure on each set.  Then, they did sets to failure with 40%, 60%, or 80% until they’d equated volume load between their two limbs.  I’d have preferred if they just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/can-we-predict-muscle-growth/&quot;&gt;equated sets to failure&lt;/a&gt; with both limbs, but the number of sets performed ended up being similar enough that equating volume load was probably fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mRCjgQamRcewVAKMpxd2_Intensity_Table_1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, biceps and quad hypertrophy was basically identical with 40%, 60%, and 80% of 1RM.  However, growth was halved with 20% of 1RM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/JuOBlwISgKGyocplI5eD_Intensity_Figure_1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets us know that, while the “hypertrophy rep range” is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; bigger than most people realize, there probably is a bottom end.  We have a lot of evidence showing similar per-set hypertrophy with loads ranging from 30% to ~85% of 1RM, but dipping down to 20% may just be too low to create adequate muscle tension to maximize growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “hypertrophy rep range” isn’t meaningfully better for hypertrophy than higher or lower rep training physiologically.  When adjusting for factors like the number of sets performed and the rest periods between sets, it &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; be slightly better on average, but there’s a lot of variability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;From a more practical perspective, the “hypertrophy rep range” is, in general, the intensity range that allows people to maximize how much hard work they can manage per workout and per week. However, looking at things from the reverse perspective (asking yourself how to maximize high quality sets per week), there is quite a bit of variability in optimal loading zone and rep range person-to-person and lift-to-lift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are probably benefits of utilizing rep ranges across the entire spectrum, so don’t neglect lower rep work and higher rep work in your training.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Training Frequency for Muscle Growth, What the Data Say</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/frequency-muscle/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/&quot;&gt;training frequency for strength development&lt;/a&gt; last week, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people asked whether higher training frequencies were also better for hypertrophy.  I responded to all of them that frequency probably doesn’t matter as much for hypertrophy.  After all, the two factors that seemed to be the most important for explaining the benefits of frequency for strength development (higher average rep velocity, and increased opportunity to practice motor patterns) don’t seem like they’d matter as much for hypertrophy.  I linked a lot of people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27102172&quot;&gt;Schoenfeld’s 2016 frequency meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, which found that frequencies of at least twice per week were better than a frequency of just once per week, with insufficient evidence to make conclusions about even higher frequencies.  But then I thought more about it, and I realized that the whole reason I wrote my last article was the recent renaissance in the frequency research.  So, I got back to the grind to analyze the effects of frequency on hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the outset, I want to make my pre-existing bias clear.  My assumption coming into this article was that, &lt;em&gt;when training volume is equated&lt;/em&gt;, higher frequencies were probably beneficial for strength, but probably didn’t matter much for hypertrophy (past a frequency of twice or &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; thrice per week).  This bias came from my observations of physical culture (a lot of successful strength training traditions preach higher frequencies, but lower frequencies &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2013/06000/Training_Practices_and_Ergogenic_Aids_Used_by_Male.20.aspx&quot;&gt;seem to be the norm&lt;/a&gt; for lifters purely focused on hypertrophy), my non-quantitative assessment of the research (several individual studies found significant strength differences in favor of higher frequencies, but very few have found significant hypertrophy differences), and my &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of focus on this issue as a coach (I mostly just train people for strength; hypertrophy is a near-universal side effect, but it’s rarely my primary focus with my athletes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of my other analyses up to this point (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/periodization-data/&quot;&gt;periodization&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/predict-strength-gains/&quot;&gt;sex differences&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/&quot;&gt;the effects of frequency on strength gains&lt;/a&gt;), the results have been more-or-less what I expected.  This time, I was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technical-notes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Notes&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#technical-notes&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to skip this section if you trust me to not fuck things up too badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by searching several databases to find all of the relevant studies, based on four criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study needed to examine the effects of training frequency &lt;em&gt;with volume and intensity per exercise or muscle group matched&lt;/em&gt;.  The training intervention needed to last at least 6 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study needed to report changes in either direct measures of hypertrophy (i.e. muscle thicknesses or cross-sectional area), or indirect measures of hypertrophy (i.e. lean body mass or circumference measurements), and provide enough information to calculate weekly training volume (sets per week).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subjects needed to be healthy and non-elderly (since age could conceivably affect the relationship between frequency and hypertrophy, as older people recover slower from training).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study needed to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From each study, I pulled all relevant info, including length of the training period, number of subjects, pre- and post-training muscle size measures/estimates, and total sets performed per week.  From there, I calculated effect sizes ((post – pre)/(pooled pre-training SD)) and percentage muscle growth ((post – pre)/pre) for each hypertrophy measure in each study.  I also calculated percentage hypertrophy per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I analyzed these studies several different ways.  I started with mixed-effects meta-analyses of effect sizes with frequency as a binary term (i.e. higher frequency vs. lower frequency), including all measures from all studies, just direct measures of hypertrophy, and just indirect measures of hypertrophy. I also calculated the pooled weekly percent hypertrophy and difference between groups for all exercises in all studies as a more easily interpretable meta-analysis, since effect sizes can sometimes seem somewhat abstract.  I weighted the percentage-based analyses by the number of subjects in the study, with adjustments for the number of analyses in each study.  For example, if a study had 5% of the total subjects in an analysis, and only one measure of hypertrophy, that single measure of hypertrophy would receive a weight of 5%.  If, on the other hand, a study had 5% of the total subjects in an analysis, but used five measures of hypertrophy, each of those measures would receive a weight of 1% (so that the total weight of the study would remain 5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made two tables for further analysis:  one table of the weekly percentage hypertrophy for each frequency in all studies, and one table of the difference in weekly percentage hypertrophy for each frequency.  In this second table, for example, a frequency of three times per week was occasionally the high frequency condition, and occasionally the low frequency condition; this allows for comparisons between a given frequency and all other frequencies (both higher and lower) to see if there’s a frequency “sweet spot” or a range of frequencies that tends to perform best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a sub-analysis, I analyzed studies comparing frequencies of once or twice per week to frequencies of 3+ times per week, and studies comparing frequencies of 1-3x per week to 4+ times per week using weekly percent hypertrophy.  As further sub-analyses, I analyzed frequency as a binary term using percentage weekly hypertrophy in studies on trained lifters, studies on untrained lifters, estimates of upper body hypertrophy, estimates of lower body hypertrophy, direct measures of hypertrophy, indirect measures of hypertrophy, studies with a low training volume (&amp;lt;10 weekly sets for a given muscle group, or &amp;lt;60 sets per week total), and studies with a high training volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#results&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen studies with a total of 305 subjects met the inclusion criteria, allowing for 40 comparisons.  The average study was 8.3 weeks long (range: 6-12 weeks) with 10.9 subjects per training group (range: 8-15).  Four studies used untrained subjects, while nine used subjects with at least some prior training experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The random effects meta-analysis of all hypertrophy measures found that higher training frequencies were associated with significantly more hypertrophy (p&amp;lt;0.0001), though the overall effect was trivial (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.113; CI=0.07-0.16).  When analyzing only direct or indirect measures of hypertrophy, the story is very similar (_d=_0.143; CI=0.09-0.19; p&amp;lt;0.0001 for direct, and &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.097; CI=0.03-0.16; p=0.0098 for indirect).&lt;/p&gt;

The overall SMD is gray.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, subjects in lower frequency groups (N=40 comparisons across 13 studies) grew at a rate of 0.42% per week, while subjects in higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.58% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.16% per week (CI=0.09-0.23%), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 38% faster, on average (i.e. 0.58% is 38% larger than 0.42%).  This would be classified as a small effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.47; CI=0.25-0.68), and the difference was significant (p&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using direct measures of hypertrophy (N=19 comparisons across 7 studies), subjects in lower frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.72% per week, while subjects in higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.85% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.12% per week (CI=-0.01-0.26%), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 17% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.35; CI=-0.02-0.72), and the difference was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; significant (p=0.079).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using indirect measures of hypertrophy (N=21 comparisons across 9 studies), subjects in lower frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.29% per week, while subjects in higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.43% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.14% per week (CI=0.06-0.22%), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 49% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a medium effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.72; CI=0.30-1.14), and the difference was significant (p=0.0031).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, untrained subjects in lower frequency groups (N=16 comparisons across 4 studies) grew at a rate of 0.39% per week, while subjects in higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.58% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.19% per week (CI=0.09-0.28%), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 47% faster, on average.

&lt;p&gt;On average, trained subjects in lower frequency groups (N=24 comparisons across 9 studies) grew at a rate of 0.44% per week, while subjects in higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.58% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.14% per week (CI=0.04-0.25%), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 32% faster, on average.

&lt;p&gt;On average, upper body hypertrophy occurred in lower frequency groups (N=17 comparisons across 8 studies) at a rate of 0.42% per week, and occurred in higher frequency groups at a rate of 0.59% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.17% per week (CI=0.03-0.31%), meaning the higher frequency groups’ upper bodies grew about 40% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a medium effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.50; CI=0.09-0.91), and the difference was significant (p=0.029).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, lower body hypertrophy occurred in lower frequency groups (N=14 comparisons across 6 studies) at a rate of 0.65% per week, and occurred in higher frequency groups at a rate of 0.83% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.18% per week (CI=0.03-0.34%), meaning the higher frequency groups’ lower bodies grew about 28% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.41; CI=0.06-0.76), and the difference was significant (p=0.038).&lt;/p&gt;

However, seven of the points come from [a single study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full), and all the comparisons in that study found either similar gains, or larger gains with lower frequency. The statistical analysis took that into account so that single study wouldn’t get undue weight.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-hypertrophy-lower-body-clarified-2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;This version of the graph only has one data point per study (the average of all measures within that study); it’s a bit more representative of what the statistical model “saw.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lower volume studies (N=16 comparisons across 7 studies), subjects in the lower frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.32% per week, on average, while subjects in the higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.57% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.25% per week (CI=0.10-0.40% per week), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 77% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a large effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.82; CI=0.34-1.30), and the difference was significant (p=0.0046).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-low-volume.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;This comparison also included the [Ochi study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full) with 7 separate comparisons, so I pooled them again here. Note that there are 8 points instead of 7 because [one study](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Citation/1985/02000/Research__Changes_in_body_composition,_body_build.4.aspx) had both male and female groups, and I represented them separately on this chart.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In higher volume studies (N=24 comparisons across 9 studies), subjects in the lower frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.46% per week, on average, while subjects in the higher frequency groups grew at a rate of 0.58% per week.  The average difference in size gains between groups was 0.12% per week (CI=0.03-0.21% per week), meaning the higher frequency groups grew about 27% faster, on average.  This would be classified as a small effect (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.34; CI=0.08-0.60), and the difference was significant (p=0.017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When simply looking at average hypertrophy reported with each frequency across all studies, there doesn’t seem to be a significant relationship between frequency and hypertrophy.  When running a simple linear regression, the correlation coefficient is basically zero (r=-0.04).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Growth-with-each-frequency.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Note: this is the most common general approach for analyzing data like this, but I feel it’s incorrect.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as explained in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/training-frequency/&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between frequency and strength gains, simply comparing the average hypertrophy seen with different frequencies doesn’t do anything to address the differences in hypertrophy observed between studies.  Imagine you have three studies.  One compares a frequency of once per week to a frequency of four times per week, the second compares a frequency of three times per week to a frequency of four times per week, and the third compares a frequency of once per week to a frequency of three times per week.  In the first study, the low frequency group (1x) grows by 2% and the high frequency group (4x) grows by 4%.  In the second study, the low frequency group (3x) grows by 4% and the high frequency group (4x) grows by 6%.  In the third study, the low frequency group (1x) grows by 8%, while the high frequency group (3x) grows by 10%.  Just averaging the size gains, you see a 5% increase with once per week [(2%+8%)/2], a 7% increase with three times per week[(4%+10%)/2], and a 5% increase [(4%+6%)/2] with four times per week.  It looks like 1x per week and 4x per week lead to similar gains, while 3x per week leads to the largest gains; however, those conclusions are driven by differences between studies, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; differences between frequencies.  With direct comparisons, on the other hand, 1x underperforms both 3x and 4x by 2%, 3x overperforms 1x by 2% and underperforms 4x by 2% (average 0%), and 4x overperforms both 1x and 3x by 2%.  This more accurately represents the results in this imaginary trio of studies, because it does a better job accounting for the variability of results between studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-hypertrophy-averages-vs-direct-comparisons.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;I feel the direct comparisons (orange dots) better represent the results of these imaginary studies than the simple averages (green dots).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a frequency of once per week (N=25 comparisons from 10 studies) was directly compared to other frequencies, it slightly &lt;em&gt;underperformed&lt;/em&gt; in direct comparisons by 0.079% per week.  A frequency of twice per week (N=17 comparisons from 7 studies) slightly &lt;em&gt;underperformed&lt;/em&gt; in direct comparisons by 0.080% per week.  A frequency of three times per week (N=21 comparisons from 7 studies) essentially performed at par in direct comparisons (minimally outperforming by 0.009% per week).  A frequency of four times per week (N=9 comparisons from 2 studies) slightly &lt;em&gt;overperformed&lt;/em&gt; by 0.087% per week.  A frequency of five times per week (N=7 comparisons from 2 studies) &lt;em&gt;overperformed&lt;/em&gt; by 0.310% per week.  And finally, a frequency of six times per week &lt;em&gt;overperformed&lt;/em&gt; by 0.194% per week, but there was only one measure from one study examining a frequency that high.  Since there are fewer studies examining higher frequencies exceeding three times per week, we’ll again pool the results of studies using frequencies of 4+ times per week (N=17 comparisons from 5 studies), finding that they &lt;em&gt;overperformed&lt;/em&gt; in direct comparisons by 0.185% per week.  Higher frequencies were associated with greater hypertrophy in direct comparisons (r=0.32, p=0.0036).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-hypertrophy-direct-comparisons-1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the linear relationship between frequency and hypertrophic overperformance in direct comparisons, I checked the results of studies comparing frequencies of once or twice per week to frequencies of 3+ times per week, and studies comparing frequencies of 1-3 times per week to frequencies of 4+ times per week to verify the results of the regression analysis.  Twenty four measures from eight studies were included in the first comparison, and 17 measures from five studies were included in the second comparison.  In both comparisons, higher frequency groups experienced significantly faster hypertrophy.  The effect size was small (_d=_0.33) when comparing frequencies 1-2 vs. 3+, and medium (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=0.51) when comparing frequencies of 1-3 vs. 4+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there seems to be a roughly linear relationship between frequency and hypertrophy, we can again analyze slopes to see how much additional hypertrophy one could expect by increasing frequency.  Each additional day of frequency increased weekly hypertrophy by 0.11% (CI=0.05-0.16% per week).  The average rate of hypertrophy across all frequencies in all studies was 0.50% per week, meaning each additional day of frequency led to 22% more hypertrophy, on average.  This slope was significantly different from zero (p=0.0004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-hypertrophy-slopes.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Each blue line represents the slope of the frequency/gains relationship in one study. The red line is the average slope, while the black lines are the top and bottom of the 95% confidence interval.  A positive slope means more hypertrophy with higher frequency, while a negative slope means more hypertrophy with lower frequency.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;discussion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#discussion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I’d like to start by saying that I feel way better about analyzing strength data than hypertrophy data.  Strength measures are generally nice and clean, and changes are generally pretty clear.  There’s not a ton of measurement error for 1RM tests or torque measurements, and strength gains are typically large enough that you can be confident you’re seeing true changes.  Plus, poor adherence to pre-testing guidelines generally won’t screw up strength tests too badly.  It’s not going to make a night-and-day difference if someone accidentally drank some caffeine before testing, or if they forgot to show up to the lab fasted (you try to control those things, of course, but sometimes human subjects lie; for strength testing, stuff like that just doesn’t make THAT big of a difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hypertrophy, on the other hand, the changes are typically much smaller (for example, the weekly strength gains in my previous analysis were roughly 4x as large as the weekly hypertrophy in this analysis, even though both analyses used mostly the same set of studies), and sometimes don’t even exceed the measurement error of the device you’re using for testing.  Poor adherence to pre-testing guidelines can also make a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference, especially for indirect measures of hypertrophy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/cheat-your-body-fat-test/&quot;&gt;this is a great article&lt;/a&gt; from James Krieger about how to mangle DEXA results).  Equipment issues are also worth noting; if you have a good ultrasound unit that shows you really clear fascial boundaries, muscle thickness or CSA measurements are a breeze; if you have an older ultrasound unit, there’s a reasonable amount of guesswork that goes into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say all of this just to note that I have a bit less confidence in these results than I had in my strength results, simply because I’m a bit less trusting of hypertrophy data in general.  Collecting good strength data is fairly easy; collecting good hypertrophy data requires more trust in your participants and your equipment, when you’re already trying to find smaller absolute changes or differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also just aren’t any comparisons in this analysis that are as clean as the effects of frequency on upper body pressing strength from the last article.  All studies on pressing strength either found larger strength gains with higher frequencies, or similar strength gains regardless of frequency.  In this article, all comparisons had &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one study finding &amp;gt;10% more hypertrophy with lower frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting in broad strokes, higher frequencies seem to have a larger effect for untrained subjects than trained subjects, for low training volumes than high training volumes, and when you’re assessing hypertrophy using indirect measures (i.e. lean body mass) than direct measures (i.e. muscle thicknesses).  Most of the differences &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; still significant in favor of higher frequencies, but the relative advantage of higher frequencies seems to be smaller if you’re a trained lifter (32% vs. 47% for untrained), if you have high training volumes (27% vs. 77% for low training volumes), and if you’re interested more in growing specific muscles than simply gaining lean mass (17% for direct measures, vs. 49% for indirect measures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Frequency-Hypertrophy-All-Effect-Sizes.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Moving left to right, the lightest color indicates a trivial effect size, the next lightest indicated a small effect size, followed by medium, and then large on the far right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question becomes:  Why might higher frequencies be better for muscle growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most obvious explanation would be that higher frequencies allow you to stimulate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nutritiontactics.com/measure-muscle-protein-synthesis/&quot;&gt;muscle protein synthesis&lt;/a&gt; (MPS) more times throughout the week.  Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the MPS data we have come from studies looking at mixed MPS, whereas myofibrillar MPS is what we really care about.  There’s also a dose-response relationship between per-session training volume and per-session MPS (i.e. muscle protein synthesis isn’t just an on/off switch; if you do more volume during a session, MPS will elevate more and be elevated for longer following that session), so it’s not clear that training a muscle more frequently with lower per-session volume actually causes more total MPS throughout an entire week.  Now, if that dose-response relationship was really fleshed out, we may be able to use that information for some theory crafting.  For example, if we found a plateau in per-session MPS after 5 sets for a given muscle, we may be able to posit, with some degree of confidence, that doing 5 sets, four times per week would be better than 10 sets, twice per week.  However, we don’t yet have that level of granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second potential explanation could simply be higher volumes with higher frequencies.  Volume during working sets was equated in all of these studies, but the higher frequency groups would have completed more total warm-up sets over the course of the program.  While warm-up sets certainly won’t affect hypertrophy as much as working sets, they still cause &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level of training stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third potential explanation may simply be the effort and energy that could be put forth in each set.  If you know you have to do a bunch of sets of the same exercise, or if you have to get through a lot of sets within a single training session, it’s natural to hold back a bit at the beginning so you’ll have some energy left at the end of the session, or to start slacking a bit near the end of the session as you start to fatigue (I’m sure that doesn’t apply to you, individually, because I’m sure you’re a total badass.  But it’s natural human tendency).  Having research assistants present to push the subjects helps rein in these tendencies, of course, but I doubt that completely ameliorated the difference in per-set effort.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29528962&quot;&gt;one of the studies&lt;/a&gt; included in this analysis, per-session internal training load was ~35% lower in the higher frequency group, and total volume load ended up being 16% higher; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/High_Resistance_Training_Frequency_Enhances_Muscle.95259.aspx&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; had very similar findings.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00744/full&quot;&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; also found lower ratings of perceived exertion (using an effort-based scale, not a reps-in-reserve based scale) in the higher frequency group.  So, we know that the subjects found each session easier, on average, which sometimes translated into higher volume loads, so I think that higher per-set effort probably played an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two questions came up repeatedly after my strength article that are worth addressing here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it OK to train the same muscle on back-to-back days when it’s still sore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Won’t higher frequencies increase injury risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the studies looking at the time course of recovery after training find that it can take 2-4+ days for muscles to fully recover after a challenging training session (depending on training status, volume, degree of eccentric stress, etc.).  Most people assume that you should wait for a muscle to fully recover before training it again.  However, there’s not any good evidence (that I’m aware of) to support that assumption.  In fact, there are three studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967584&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27682004&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Citation/1985/02000/Research__Changes_in_body_composition,_body_build.4.aspx&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;) comparing consecutive versus nonconsecutive training (i.e. training the same muscles on back-to-back-to-back days, versus resting at least 48 hours between training sessions for the same muscle group), and none of the three have found any negative effects for consecutive training.  Now, all three of those studies used untrained or recreationally trained lifters, but they’re the only direct evidence we have.  Also, keep in mind that with higher frequencies, per-session volume per muscle group should be lower, which makes training the same muscle on back-to-back days much more doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for injury risk, I think there’s a scientifically correct answer, and a practically correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5954586/&quot;&gt;recent study in powerlifters&lt;/a&gt; found pretty weak associations between training frequency and injury risk (in some analyses, there was a positive association; and in some analyses, there was a negative association).  Furthermore, most &lt;em&gt;acute&lt;/em&gt; injuries tend to occur when you’re fatigued, and focus or motor control start slipping, so I’d assume that higher frequencies may decrease acute injury risk by decreasing per-session volume.  I think the effect of frequency on chronic injury risk would largely be determined by technical proficiency. With good technique, I doubt higher frequencies would increase chronic injury risk. With poor technique, though, it wouldn’t surprise me if higher frequencies increased chronic injury risk by frequently exposing your tendons and/or ligaments to excessive stress.  That’s the scientific answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical answer is that is probably depends on how you approach training psychologically.  If you like to go all-out on every set and keep per-session volume high for each muscle group you train so that you feel like you’ve really thrashed yourself by the end of a workout, high frequencies are probably a very bad idea for you.  If you take a more relaxed approach to training (and lift with good technique), you’ll probably be fine with higher frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one final issue I want to address before wrapping up:  If you’re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/become-a-member-of-the-weightology-research-review/&quot;&gt;Weightology&lt;/a&gt; subscriber, you probably know that James Krieger has a guide covering this same topic (and if you’re not a Weightology subscriber, you should rectify that issue right after you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/mass/&quot;&gt;subscribe to MASS&lt;/a&gt;).  If you’ve read it, you’ll probably also notice that our results differ.  There are a few reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James includes a few studies that I don’t.  There’s a study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266318419_Effects_of_8_weeks_equal-volume_resistance_training_with_different_workout_frequency_on_maximal_strength_endurance_and_body_composition&quot;&gt;Arazi and Abbas&lt;/a&gt; I didn’t include because it doesn’t include any information about training volume.  His analysis also includes a few unpublished studies that are currently in review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the dose-response relationship between frequency and hypertrophy, it seems that James is pooling the effect sizes and percent increases with each frequency, rather than analyzing how each frequency performs in direct comparisons against other frequencies.  That is certainly the standard approach, but as I explained in this article, I think it’s more apt to pick up differences between studies, rather than differences between frequencies within those studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit:  I spoke with James, and he said he model does also model between-study variance.  I’d need to dig into the nuts and bolts of his model more to fully understand the issue, then, because our results differ drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For these analyses, I tend to take a slightly more liberal (but certainly still valid) statistical approach than James.  My reasoning for this is that my audience is primarily composed of lifters and coaches, and I think lifters and coaches should approach type I and type II error differently than scientists. [ A brief philosophy of science interlude ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, a type I error – a false positive – is the type of error you aim to avoid at all costs.  On the other hand, a type II error – a false negative – is much more acceptable.  If A is not different from B, but you say it is, that’s really bad.  If A &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different from B, but you say it isn’t, that’s not nearly as big of a deal.  There are a few reasons that science is oriented this way, but the main purpose is to keep people from spending a ton of time and research dollars attempting to investigate and flesh out an idea that wasn’t true in the first place.  Science is a self-correcting process, but you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to make sure that most of the time and resources within the sciences are spent making actual progress, not self-correcting avoidable mistakes.  The stakes are often quite high as well.  If you’re developing a new drug, you want to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; confident it’s better than the currently prescribed drug that it’s replacing, because being wrong could cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an athlete or coach, the calculus is different.  The stakes are generally lower (it’s not a life-or-death situation; you’ll probably be able to make gains with any training frequency), and the standard of evidence you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; require before making a decision should be lower as well.  When troubleshooting a lifter’s training program, you rarely have the luxury of waiting to try something new until you’re 95%+ confident you’re making the absolute optimal choice for that athlete.  If you’re 70% sure something will help, and the costs or risks associated with that decision are minimal, it typically makes sense to pull the trigger.  &lt;em&gt;Type II errors (the opportunity cost of forgoing something that could have helped) are just as costly as type I errors (trying something that doesn’t help).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of that being said, the analyses I run are still kosher procedures that certainly prioritize limiting Type I errors.  I’m still calculating confidence intervals and aiming to reject a null hypothesis (a maximally liberal approach would involve just comparing mean point estimates).  They’re just not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as conservative as James’ analyses, because I also don’t want to unnecessarily inflate type II error, given the audience of this site and the purpose of my articles (making recommendations that have the highest probability of being helpful for athletes and coaches). [/end interlude]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one final point before we wrap up:  I think the volume-matched literature (reviewed in this article) may underestimate the effects of frequency on hypertrophy.  We know that volume seems to be the largest driver of hypertrophy, and &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; increases in frequency allow for increases in volume.  Doing 20 sets of squats in a single session will mangle most people, but doing 5 sets of squats, four times per week is generally challenging but doable.  I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that higher frequencies may increase the risk inherent in increasing volume, though.  If you only train legs once per week and you go overboard in one session, at least you have a week to recover before training legs again; most people can recover from damn near anything in a week.  If you train legs four times per week and your volume is too high, however, it’s easier to keep digging yourself deeper and deeper into a hole, increasing your risk of overreaching or overtraining.  So, increasing frequency can be beneficial, but you need to be smart about it. Effectively monitoring recovery probably becomes more important with higher training frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;practical-recommendations-for-training-frequency&quot;&gt;Practical Recommendations for Training Frequency &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#practical-recommendations-for-training-frequency&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s end with some practical recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently making progress on a low frequency training program, don’t change anything.  When you plateau, however, consider increasing your training frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many lifters, anecdotally, find that they can tolerate higher frequencies for some exercises or muscle groups but not others.  Higher training frequencies are worth a shot, but keep in mind that your personal responses may not mirror the average response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you increase your training frequency, start by distributing your current training volume over more days per week.  Don’t increase volume until you see how you respond and how well you can recover between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If training purely for hypertrophy with a high frequency, consider alternating between more and less taxing exercises for each muscle group.  For example, if you do squats on Monday to train quads, do something lighter like step-ups or split squats on Tuesday or Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d primarily recommend higher frequencies when training to bring up weak points, or when weekly volume for a given muscle group is low.  They’re useful in other contexts, but those are the situations where I think they’d give you the largest return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve made it this far, you should consider signing up for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/mass/&quot;&gt;Monthly Applications in Strength Sport&lt;/a&gt;.

		<title>The Evidence is Lacking for “Effective Reps”</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/effective-reps/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The idea that the last 5 reps before failure are &amp;quot;effective reps,&amp;quot; and therefore the ones that REALLY matter for hypertrophy, doesn&#39;t actually have much experimental support. In this article, I&#39;ll re-examine the evidence for &amp;quot;effective reps&amp;quot; and put forth a (hopefully better) model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote an article titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/can-we-predict-muscle-growth/&quot;&gt;Can We Predict Muscle Growth?&lt;/a&gt;” It’s still a pretty good read, but if you don’t have the time or inclination to wade through two pretty long articles today, I’ll save you some effort. Here was the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“At this point you may be saying, ‘Holy crap, dude. You’re basically saying that there’s no good way to predict how much I’ll grow from my training?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To which I’d respond: Yep, pretty much.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of the available tools, I personally think tracking the number of hard sets per muscle is the most useful, followed closely by relative volume, but all of them are pretty rough and have pretty big drawbacks.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn’t sit well with some people because a lot of us (and I assume this disproportionately applies to people who are into science) like to quantify things in a way that we hope will yield predictive insights. When we set up a training program, we want to know what outcomes to expect given the quantifiable inputs that go into it. However, as you can tell, I didn’t think we were there yet back in 2016, at least in general. It’s not that we don’t have a rough idea of what will cause muscle growth; it’s just that we can’t predict that a particular change to a particular program will reliably cause a change in hypertrophy of x% on a group level. I think our current understanding is a bit like a map and a compass rather than turn-by-turn directions: It can point us in the right general direction, but not tell us exactly how to get from point A to point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, however, an old idea has been revamped and risen to prominence: effective reps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot_20190907-165714.png&quot;&gt;I polled my audience&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram while writing this article, and 62% said they bought into the “effective reps” model (with over 2.5k votes), which tells me that it’s a pretty commonly-held belief, at least in my little corner of the internet (and that I should probably brace for some hate mail from this article). There are a few different iterations of this idea floating around, but the one that has gained the most traction seems to be&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SandCResearch/what-is-training-volume-286b8da6f427&quot;&gt; Chris Beardsley’s&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href=&quot;https://borgefagerli.com/myo-reps-in-english/&quot;&gt;Borge Fagerli&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/quantifying-hypertrophic-reps-and-hypertrophic-volume-load/&quot;&gt; James Krieger&lt;/a&gt; [paywall] and&lt;a href=&quot;https://sigmanutrition.com/episode225/&quot;&gt; Carl Juneau&lt;/a&gt; have written about it as well). In simple terms, the idea is that the last 5 reps before failure are “stimulatory reps” because they involve both full motor unit recruitment and slow contraction velocities. Now, I will note that Chris has actually written quite a lot about this idea, and his understanding of hypertrophy is more nuanced than “it’s the last 5 reps that matter, and nothing else.” However, as is often the case on the internet, it’s the simplistic version of the idea that’s gained significant purchase, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SandCResearch/what-is-training-volume-286b8da6f427&quot;&gt; this&lt;/a&gt; is the specific article (or&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BlU1j8AnPiP/?hl=en&quot;&gt; Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;) people share to support their point. That’s primarily what I’ll be attempting to rebut in this article, but I want to make it clear that I’m not trying to refute everything Chris has ever said on the topic, and I’m not attempting to conflate Chris’s actual beliefs with the simplified version of his beliefs that has gotten popular. I just want to make the point that the idea that the last 5 reps before failure are “effective reps,” and therefore the ones that REALLY matter for hypertrophy, doesn’t actually have all that much experimental support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you have an idea of where I plan for this article to go, here’s the rough layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the mechanistic rationale and evidence underpinning the “effective reps” idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critique of the mechanistic rationale for “effective reps.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A re-examination of the evidence for “effective reps.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thorough overview of studies where sets are matched, but different groups terminate each set at different proximities to failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An additional look at studies that are informative, presented in a slightly less systematic fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make sure this article is useful, I’ll end by trying to make sense of the evidence, and put forth a (hopefully better) model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-an-overview-of-the-mechanistic-rationale&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Effective Reps” – An Overview of the Mechanistic Rationale&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-an-overview-of-the-mechanistic-rationale&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understand Chris’s rationale correctly, there are two primary reasons one should expect the last 5 reps before concentric failure to be the ones that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter for hypertrophy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 5 reps from failure is approximately the point where full motor unit recruitment occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near failure, when shortening velocities are low, each recruited fiber is experiencing more mechanical tension (force), and is thus receiving a larger stimulus to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen two different reasons put forth for why ~5 reps from failure is approximately when basically all motor units are recruited, and thus reps start “counting.” The first comes from classic isometric&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10423192&quot;&gt; work&lt;/a&gt; (which is discussed in basically any introductory exercise physiology textbook), where motor unit recruitment increased up to approximately 85ish% of maximal voluntary contractile force, with rate coding (the rate at which each motor unit fires) accounting for further increases in force past that point. We also know that motor unit recruitment increases with fatigue&lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP278056&quot;&gt; as people approach failure&lt;/a&gt;. Since 85% of 1RM is approximately a 5RM load, it’s thus believed that you recruit basically all motor units from the very first rep when training with 5RM loads, or during the last 5 reps during a set to failure. The second reason I’ve seen put forth for why the last 5 reps are the ones that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter comes from research showing that muscle EMG (electrical activity, which should be roughly associated with fiber recruitment and discharge rate) increases early in a set, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21986694&quot;&gt; plateaus&lt;/a&gt; at a high level approximately 3-5 reps before failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sundstrup-emg.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;The second reason I&#39;ve seen put forth for effective reps comes from research showing that muscle EM increases early in a set, and plateaus at a high level approximately 3-5 reps before failure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the necessity of low shortening velocities relates to the well-known muscle force-velocity relationship. Muscle fibers can only generate low forces when concentrically contracting at high velocities, and can generate high forces when concentrically contracting at low velocities. The rate that actin-myosin cross-bridges can form is relatively low, while the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18022371&quot;&gt; rate they detach increases&lt;/a&gt; as contraction velocity increases. This means that at high contraction velocities, only a fraction of the possible actin-myosin cross-bridges can form, and thus tension on the individual muscle fiber is low; at low velocities, way more actin-myosin cross-bridges are active at any given point in time, and thus tension on the muscle fiber is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/force-velocity.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;basic force-velocity relationship&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that it’s incredibly reasonable for fiber recruitment and high tension on each fiber to be the two main things to care about when developing a model of hypertrophy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00685.2018?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;journalCode=jappl&quot;&gt;Mechanical tension&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the primary initiator of the cellular processes that lead to muscle growth, so the “effective reps” model is definitely prioritizing the right things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-an-overview-of-the-evidence-in-favor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Effective Reps” – An Overview of the Evidence in Favor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-an-overview-of-the-evidence-in-favor&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of “effective reps” helps explain the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28834797&quot;&gt; well-documented finding&lt;/a&gt; that, when sets are taken to failure, the rep range you train in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/&quot;&gt; doesn’t affect muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/&quot;&gt;very wide array of rep ranges&lt;/a&gt; (from probably 5 or 6 reps per set on the low end, up to probably 30-40ish reps per set on the high end). If you’re doing at least 5 reps per set, and you’re going to failure on every set, you’re always getting in 5 “effective reps” per set, so each set is similarly effective for muscle growth regardless of the rep range you’re training in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “effective reps” model also makes sense of the supposition that per-set hypertrophy is lower when doing fewer than 5 reps per set (if there are fewer than 5 reps per set, there are necessarily fewer than 5 “effective reps” per set, so a set to failure with more reps has the potential for more effective reps if taken to failure). The “effective reps” model also makes sense of the supposition that longer rest periods are beneficial for hypertrophy; when fatigue accumulates, it can&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SandCResearch/do-short-rest-periods-help-or-hinder-muscle-growth-7859e0c4adfd&quot;&gt; inhibit motor unit recruitment&lt;/a&gt; and force output, reducing tension on the fibers you’re trying to train (effectively decreasing the number of “effective reps” during a set to failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thus far, the “effective reps” model is looking pretty good. It seems to have a strong theoretical rationale, and it makes sense of several important findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-critique-of-the-mechanistic-underpinnings-for-%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Critique of the Mechanistic Underpinnings for “Effective Reps”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#a-critique-of-the-mechanistic-underpinnings-for-%E2%80%9Ceffective-reps%E2%80%9D&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrarian in me wants to argue against the assumption that a fiber has to be recruited in order to grow. We know that tension-sensitive mechanisms are largely responsible for initiating hypertrophy, but we also know that a substantial amount of tension can be “felt” by fibers that aren’t recruited via the production of force that’s transmitted laterally from recruited fibers into the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12485685&quot;&gt; matrix of connective tissue&lt;/a&gt; that runs through the muscle. And, since it’s difficult to study individual fibers or motor units, I don’t think we know for sure that a fiber &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have to be recruited in order to grow. However, I’m not quite that much of a contrarian, so I’ll assent that it’s a perfectly fair assumption that fibers need to be recruited, at least to maximize growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am somewhat skeptical, however, about whether we need to get up to ~85% 1RM or within ~5 reps of failure to reach essentially full motor unit recruitment, at least in a particular context that a lot of serious lifters would care about: when considering the prime movers of multi-joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we do tend to see that EMG increases as load increases during single-joint training, and we do tend to see that EMG increases as contraction intensity increases during isometric training, it’s not always that simple with multi-joint exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095625&quot;&gt; recent study by van den Tillaar&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues, EMG of the quad muscles barely changed as load increased from 50% to 90% of 1RM in the squat when subjects were instructed to lift explosively. A&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625190&quot;&gt; prior study by McBride et al&lt;/a&gt; had similar findings: similar vastus lateralis EMG in the squat with 70% and 90% 1RM loads. A&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5400411/&quot;&gt; study by Król and Golaś&lt;/a&gt; also found that pec EMG in the concentric phase of the bench press was basically unaffected by increasing loads from 70% to 100% of 1RM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3x8QulhtSkCfDlol4uDD_Squat_Table_2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;effective reps – pec EMG in the concentric phase of the bench press was basically unaffected by increasing loads from 70% to 100% of 1RM&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in all three of these studies, the EMG activity of secondary muscles (hip extensors in van den Tillaar, hamstrings in McBride, and triceps and front delts in Król and Golaś) did increase as load increased. Notably, all three of these studies used trained lifters. Thus, it’s possible that for trained lifters performing multi-joint exercises, they’re able to recruit virtually all motor units for the primary muscle trained by a multi-joint exercise with substantially lower loads and pretty far away from failure, with activation of secondary muscles ramping up as load increases or as they approach failure. So, if you’re benching for triceps growth or squatting for glute growth, you may need to go pretty close to failure to recruit most motor units, but if you’re benching for pec growth or squatting for quad growth, you may be recruiting the vast majority of your motor units from rep 1, even with moderate (i.e. 70% 1RM, or 12RM) loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also skeptical of the claim that the slow contraction speeds during the last five reps prior to failure are indicative of greater tension on the recruited fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the force-velocity relationship of muscle (higher forces at lower velocities) is true and very well-supported, it’s important to remember the contexts in which it was established: isolated muscle fibers contracting &lt;em&gt;one time&lt;/em&gt; at different velocities, and dynamic movements performed once (or a very small number of times) at different velocities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you’ll notice that those contexts differ substantially from a set of reps with a given load taken to failure; the research establishing the force-velocity relationship was performed on muscles or fibers that were unfatigued. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145945/&quot;&gt;Fatigue changes things.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, here’s pilot data from someone who helped me out when I was refining my protocol for my thesis project (this data was chosen at random; everyone’s data looks basically exactly like this, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With loads increasing from 30% to 100% of this person’s max, force output increases basically linearly, while velocity decreases basically linearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/force-velocity-bench-press.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;effective reps – changes in force and velocity with changes in load&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, during a single set to failure with 75% of 1RM, force output and velocity both decrease as this individual approaches failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/force-velocity-fatigue.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;effective reps – changes in force and velocity with acute fatigue&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the disconnect: when you’re changing loads and moving every load as explosively as possible, you see a decrease in velocity along with increases in force. With the same load, however, a decrease in velocity also means a decrease in force. Unless I’m missing something obvious, I don’t see why this same principle wouldn’t also apply to individual muscle fibers. As an unfatigued fiber contracts against increasing forces, velocity will also decrease. However, as a fiber fatigues, the tension it can produce also decreases. Moreover,&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107385849600200407&quot;&gt; central mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; can&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11581501&quot;&gt; decrease the motor unit’s firing rate&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that even if a given fiber could keep producing as much force if maximally stimulated, it still won’t be able to &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; because signals from its motor nerve won’t reach it at the same frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept is illustrated in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005581&quot;&gt; 2017 paper by Potvin and Fuglevand&lt;/a&gt;. As I understand it, it’s generally accepted as the best motor unit-based model of muscle fatigue we have, incorporating a considerable amount of mechanistic evidence and producing predictions that match up well with experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat of the paper models the effects of holding isometric contractions of 20%, 50%, and 80% of maximal voluntary contraction force until failure, as well as the effects of sustaining a maximal contraction for 200 seconds (presented below, in that order).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot going on in the following graphics, but here are some landmarks to pay attention to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The motor unit labeled “100” is pretty near the top of the high threshold motor units, while the motor unit labeled “120” is the highest threshold motor unit, and thus the last one recruited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The left side of the graphs looking at the effects of the sustained maximal contraction give you a reference point for each motor unit’s maximal firing rate (top right graph) and force output (bottom left graph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bottom left graph (MU force) is probably the most important for each of these groups. It shows the amount of force each motor unit would actually be producing at each point in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you there was a lot going on in these graphics, so let’s break this down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of a maximal contraction, the force produced by MU 100 is approximately 42x greater than the tetanic force of MU 1, and the force produced by MU 120 is almost 60x greater than the tetanic force of MU 1. You can think of those values as the maximal tension the fibers associated with those MUs can be exposed to. Similarly, the maximal firing rate is about 30Hz for MU 100, and about 25Hz for MU 120.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During a 50% sustained contraction, MU 100 and MU 120 wind up with peak contractile forces a bit less than 25x the tetanic force of MU 1. During an 80% sustained contraction, MU 100 starts at a contractile force of approximately 42x greater than the tetanic force of MU 1, with force output decreasing over time. MU 120 is recruited from the very start of the contraction, but its initial force output and firing rate are both very low, with force output eventually ramping up to approximately 32x the tetanic force of MU 1.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, MU 100 only reaches about 2/3 of its maximal force output during a 50% contraction, while MU 120 doesn’t even reach 1/2 of its maximal force output. During an 80% contraction, MU 100 does attain maximal force output, and it does so &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; in the contraction (not near the point of failure), while MU 120 still only reaches slightly more than 1/2 of its maximal force output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, dynamic contractions clearly aren’t identical to isometric contractions. However, I still think this is a useful model, and due to the effects of fatigue on motor unit firing rates and force capacity, a few things seem likely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your very highest threshold motor units probably don’t simultaneously get recruited &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reach maximal firing rates (and thus maximal force output/tension) unless force output is very close to maximal: not 80%, but 100% or &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lower-to-moderate loads (i.e. 50% 1RM), a hefty chunk of your higher threshold motor units (not just your very highest threshold motor units) do get recruited, but probably don’t get particularly close to reaching maximal force/tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With higher loads (i.e. 80% 1RM or 8RM loads), a lot of your high-threshold motor units probably attain maximal tension pretty early in a set before fatigue starts setting in, and are actually producing considerably less force in the few reps before failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a pretty clear conflict between Potvin’s model, “effective reps,” and longitudinal evidence. If a fiber needs to be recruited &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; exposed to near-maximal tension in order to grow, you’d expect lower loads (i.e. 50% of 1RM) to be dramatically worse for muscle growth than higher loads (i.e. 80% of 1RM) on a per-set basis, since basically all of the high threshold motor units &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; recruited lower loads, but are likely only exposed to a fraction of their maximal force output, even when a set is taken to failure. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/muscle-fiber-type/&quot;&gt;longitudinal research indicates&lt;/a&gt; that heavier and lighter training lead to similar increases in both whole-muscle hypertrophy and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174923&quot;&gt; fiber-type specific hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;. This conflict could be resolved in one of two different ways: 1) Potvin’s model is wrong, or is so specific to isometric contractions that it’s completely irrelevant for dynamic contractions (I do think it’s likely that the picture is messier with dynamic contractions, but the physiology the model is based on – specifically how motor unit behavior changes with fatigue – is basic and sound, so I doubt things are &lt;em&gt;fundamentally&lt;/em&gt; different) or 2) the “maximal tension” assumption of the “effective reps” model is faulty, because it both assumes an incorrect interpretation of the force-velocity relationship, and because it doesn’t adequately account for the ways fatigue affects motor unit behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13451285_10207337304575713_996889718_n.png.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Similar changes in type I and type II fiber CSA after high load and low load training.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up this section, I think the relationship between external load and motor unit recruitment is more complex for multi-joint exercises than the “effective reps” model accounts for (such that basically full motor unit recruitment may occur at lower loads and further from failure than would be suggested based on isometric and single-joint research), and the assumption that fibers need to be exposed to maximal tension in order to grow seems to conflict with model-based research, longitudinal research, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this section, I want to start by focusing on the research that’s the most directly relevant for evaluating the predictive power of the “effective reps” model: research with at least one direct measure of hypertrophy where either total sets or total reps are pretty closely equated, but two groups or conditions train at different proximities from failure during “normal” training (i.e. not doing cluster sets or drop sets or anything fancy that just introduces additional variables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By my count, there are eight relevant studies.  They’ll be graphically summarized below if you just want to scroll until you see a multi-colored bar graph.  I’d recommend reading this section, but it’s pretty long and dry (just summarizing each of these eight studies), so I wouldn’t hold it against you if you skipped it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects:&lt;/strong&gt; 18 young men with between 2 and 5 years of training experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol:&lt;/strong&gt; 6 weeks of training twice per week, with a frequency of once per muscle group per week. One group did 4 sets of 10 reps to failure for all exercises (with ~75% of 1RM), while the other group did 8 sets of 5 reps with similar relative loads (i.e. ~75% of 1RM), thus staying far from failure. The direct measures of hypertrophy were vastus medialis thickness, elbow flexor thickness, and anterior deltoid thickness. Of note, the subjects only did one exercise that directly targeted the quads (squats; they also did deadlifts, though deadlifts probably don’t cause much quad hypertrophy), but they did four exercises that directly or indirectly trained the biceps (barbell curls, DB curls, underhand grip rows, and pull-downs), and four exercises that directly or indirectly trained the front delts (bench press, chest press, shoulder press, and front delt raises).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Vastus medialis thickness increased significantly more (p = 0.026) in the group doing 4x10RM (5.92% vs. 0.63%), but increases in elbow flexor thickness and anterior delt thickness were similar between groups (8.6% vs. 5.08% and 8.03% vs. 11.65% for the 4x10RM and the 8×5 groups, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 21 men with at least two years of training experience, a 1RM squat of at least 1.5x bodyweight, and a 1RM bench of at least 1.25x bodyweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: 8 weeks of training with a squat and bench press frequency of 3x/week. One group trained using pre-defined percentages, and the other group did the same sets and reps with loading based on target RPE ranges. The RPE group ended up training ~1-3 reps closer to failure through most of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: There were no significant differences between group’s increases in pec thickness or vastus lateralis thickness at two different sites (5.61% vs. 6.21%; 7.53% vs. 6.96%; and 9.92% vs. 9.66% in the percentage and RPE groups, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 28 untrained men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: Following a 4-week familiarization phase, subjects were randomized into three groups doing 4 sets of curls 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Two groups did sets of 4 (one group did fast eccentrics and 2-second eccentrics, while one group did fast eccentrics and concentrics), and one group performed all sets to failure. All groups started at 85% 1RM, and loads were adjusted each week based on performance. The two non-failure groups also performed one set to failure per week to gauge progress, and also to more-or-less match volume load with the failure group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: The two non-failure groups averaged about 2 fewer reps per set than the failure group (4.2 vs. 6.1). However, gains in elbow flexor cross-sectional area were similar between group (10.9% and 7.1% for the two non-failure groups, and 11.6% for the failure group).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 18 untrained men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: The subjects trained twice per week for 12 weeks doing knee extensions (they also did shoulder press and pull-downs, but there weren’t any assessments of hypertrophy relevant to those exercises). One group did 5 sets of 10 reps; the first set was performed with 75% of a 10RM load, and load was adjusted from there to allow for 10 reps per set. The other group followed the same protocol, except that they rested for 30 seconds between the 5th and 6th rep of each set, effectively making each set two mini-sets and (presumably) keeping the subjects further from failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: Increases in quad cross-sectional area were larger in the group doing traditional sets than the group employing an intra-set rest (12.9% vs. 4.0%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 24 young men with 1.5-4 years of training experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: Subjects trained twice per week for 8 weeks doing 3 sets of Smith machine squats in both sessions. Over the course of the study, training loads increased from ~70% 1RM to ~85% 1RM. One group terminated each set after their concentric velocity within the set decreased by 40%, while another group terminated each set after their concentric velocity within the set decreased by 20%. As a result, the group training with a velocity loss of 40% reached failure on 56.3% of their sets, whereas the group training with a velocity loss of 20% never reached failure. There were also large differences in the total number of reps performed (~67% more in the 40% velocity loss group), and in the number of reps performed at relatively slow velocities (&amp;lt;0.5m/s; ~90 in the 40% velocity loss group vs. ~10 in the 20% velocity loss group).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: Total muscle volume of the quads increased in both groups; while results leaned in favor of the 40% velocity loss group, the difference wasn’t statistically significant (7.7% vs. 4.6%). Mean fiber cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis also increased in both groups, without significant differences between groups (10.19% vs. 8.69% in the 40% and 20% loss groups, respectively). Interestingly, the mean fiber area of the IIx fibers (presumably the highest threshold motor units, though we need to be cautious as fiber typing was done via staining) increased non-significantly more in the 20% loss group (17.51% vs. 11.82%), which would seem to run counter to the supposition that you need to train very close to failure to maximally stimulate the highest threshold motor units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 89 untrained young women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: The subjects did curls twice per week for 10 weeks. One group did 3 sets to failure with 70% of 1RM, one group 3 sets of 7 with 70% of 1RM, and one group did 4 sets of 7 with 70% of 1RM in an effort to match volume load with the group training to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: The group training to failure increased biceps muscle thickness by 17.5%, the group doing 4 sets of 7 increased biceps muscle thickness by 8.5%, and the group doing 3 sets of 7 increased biceps muscle thickness by just 2.1%. The authors didn’t run the correct statistical tests to determine whether those gains were significantly different, but it’s highly likely that there were significant differences between all groups unless the variance in the training response within each group was astronomically high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 27 untrained young men&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: This study used a within-subject unilateral design, meaning that for each participant, one leg was assigned to one protocol, and their other leg was assigned to another protocol. Subjects performed unilateral knee extensions with either a high load (80% of 1RM) to a low load (30% of 1RM), stopping each set either at failure (actually missing a rep) or “volitional interruption” (which, as best I can tell, meant stopping each set when they thought they couldn’t do another rep, but before they actually failed). Training took place twice per week for 12 weeks, and the subjects performed three sets per leg per workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: Vastus lateralis cross-sectional area increased similarly in all four conditions (6.9% high load to failure, 7.1% high load to volitional interruption, 7.5% low load to failure, 6.1% low load to volitional interruption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;: 15 men with an average of 7.7 years of training experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocol&lt;/strong&gt;: Subjects trained three times per week for 10 weeks. One group trained using relative intensities, and one group trained using rep maxes. The relative intensity group based their training on a percentage of their set and rep best in theory (so, for example, if you could do 3 sets of 10 reps with 100kg, a relative intensity of 85% would mean doing 3 sets of 10 at 85kg), but they effectively trained using reps in reserve, stopping sets 2-6 reps shy of failure two days per week, and staying even further from failure (4-10 reps shy of failure) on the third day of each week. The rep max group used loads where their last set of each exercise reached failure. They also did sprint training two days per week. Over the course of the study, the subjects did some clean pulls and a few step-ups, but the bulk of the quad work they did (which is where hypertrophy was assessed) was just three sets of squats on the first and third training day of each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: All hypertrophy measures were taken from the vastus lateralis. The relative intensity group had a significantly larger increase in anatomical cross-sectional area (8.77% vs. 3.24%). All other measures leaned in favor of the relative intensity group, but the differences weren’t statistically significant (13.52% vs. 7.00% for type I fiber CSA; 24.00% vs. 12.49% for type II fiber CSA; 23.58% vs. 14.11% for muscle thickness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s step back and get a lay of the land. There are two studies where training to failure or closer to failure produced clearly superior gains compared to stopping further from failure (Goto and Martorelli). There’s also a single measure in another study where training to failure seemed to be superior (vastus lateralis hypertrophy in the Karsten study; elbow flexor and anterior deltoid hypertrophy were similar between groups in the same study). There’s also one study where stopping further from failure was clearly superior (Carroll). So, out of a total of 18 measures across 8 studies, the group doing more “effective reps” – often &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more “effective reps” – experienced significantly more growth just three times (and experienced significantly less growth once). That doesn’t strike me as particularly strong experimental support. If we just take a simple average of all of these measures, we come up with an 8.9% increase in muscle size when staying further from failure, and a 9.2% increase in size when going to failure or closer to failure. If we pool the results of each study before averaging (so studies with more measures don’t get undue weight), it’s 7.8% vs. 10.3%. That does perhaps seem to slightly lean in favor of greater growth when going closer to failure, but when many of these studies compare programs with multi-fold differences in “effective reps,” but growth is still fairly comparable, it certainly seems to put the concept of “effective reps” on very shaky footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/effective-reps-studies.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;hypertrophy in studies with different proximities to failure&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we drill down into the details of these studies, an interesting pattern emerges. There are four studies on trained lifters (Karsten, Helms, Pareja-Blanco, and Carroll) and four studies on untrained lifters (Sampson, Goto, Martorelli, and Nóbrega). All four studies on trained lifters used mostly multi-joint exercises, and all four studies on untrained lifters used single-joint exercises. In the studies on trained lifters using multi-joint exercises, there’s no real difference between going closer to failure or staying further from failure: a 9.5% increase staying further from failure versus a 8.3% difference going closer to failure. However, in the studies on untrained lifters using single-joint exercises, things lean &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; in favor of going to failure or closer to failure, with the groups going closer to failure experiencing almost twice as much growth on average: 12.3% vs. 6.2%. This finding will be discussed more later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re at it, I also want to address two of the other suppositions I previously alluded to that “effective reps” are supposed to help explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first supposition is that low rep training (&amp;lt;5 reps per set) doesn’t build muscle as effectively on a per-set basis as moderate rep training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really only have three studies directly comparing low rep and moderate rep training where sets are equated. The one everyone cites is&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5131226/&quot;&gt; this paper by Schoenfeld et al.&lt;/a&gt;, comparing the effects of training at 2-4RM loads versus 8-12RM loads with sets equated. It pretty clearly shows more hypertrophy of the quads (large between-group effect size; 0.84) when training with 8-12RM loads, but the between-group effect sizes for elbow flexor and elbow extensor hypertrophy were both trivial (&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; = 0.14 and 0.04). A similar&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562558/&quot;&gt; study by Mangine et al.&lt;/a&gt;, however, compared the effects of training at 3-5RM loads versus 10-12RM with sets equated, and found significantly greater gains in arm lean mass, along with a bunch of other non-significant differences. Digging back a little further,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10721510&quot;&gt; Weiss et al.&lt;/a&gt; compared the effects of training at 3-5RM loads versus 11-13RM loads, and found no significant differences in either quad or hamstrings hypertrophy. And if you don’t mind sparing 3-5RM training an extra set,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12436270&quot;&gt; Campos et al.&lt;/a&gt; didn’t find significant differences in quad hypertrophy when comparing training with 4×3-5RM versus 3×9-11RM. So, I guess it’s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that shifting down by one rep from 3-5RM loads to 2-4RM loads makes all the difference in the world (or that 3-5RM actually means exactly 5RM, so the subjects can get in all 5 of their effective reps per set), but I just don’t think we can claim with a tremendous amount of confidence that low rep training is worse for growth on a per-set basis. I strongly suspect that heavy singles and doubles aren’t ideal for growth, but how about sets of 3 or 4? I sort of suspect that the bottom end of the “hypertrophy range” extends a bit lower than 5 or 6 reps per set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second supposition is that short rest intervals lead to less growth,&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SandCResearch/do-short-rest-periods-help-or-hinder-muscle-growth-7859e0c4adfd&quot;&gt; because central fatigue limits motor unit recruitment&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the amount of “effective reps” you can do per set. Again, everyone cites&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26605807&quot;&gt; this study by Schoenfeld et al.&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that short rest intervals decrease hypertrophy&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19077743&quot;&gt; (another study by Buresch&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues had similar findings). However,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294666&quot;&gt; this study by Villaneueva et al.&lt;/a&gt; in older men found that shorter rest intervals enhanced gains in lean body mass, and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28032435&quot;&gt; this study by Fink et al.&lt;/a&gt; found that doing curls for sets of 20 with a 30-second rest interval basically doubled biceps growth compared to doing sets of 8 with a 3-minute rest interval (which is notable because, all else being equal, sets of 8 and sets of 20 should be similarly effective for hypertrophy). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0042-119204&quot;&gt;This study by Fink et al.&lt;/a&gt; also failed to find significant differences between 30-second and 150-second rest intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up this section, if the direct experimental evidence for “effective reps” is murky at best (and relies almost entirely on studies utilizing untrained lifters doing single-joint training), and if two of the other findings that “effective reps” are supposed to explain are actually on pretty shaky footing in their own right, I’m left wondering what, exactly, the “effective reps” model does for us in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-ramblings-about-hypertrophy&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Ramblings about Hypertrophy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#general-ramblings-about-hypertrophy&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take a step back for a moment, and admit I may have been a tad too harsh in the previous section. In fact, I hope I was. The thing that bothers me the most about how I’m seeing people discuss “effective reps” is that many people aren’t acting like it’s a rough model, but rather, they’re discussing it as if it’s a proven fact. Chris and others have made the case for “effective reps” at length and quite compellingly, so I wanted to present a somewhat aggressive case against it. I don’t expect everyone who’s bought into the model to throw it out on the spot, but I do hope that they’ll consider some of my points, temper their enthusiasm a bit, and hopefully approach the subject with a bit more circumspection and nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully now I can add a bit to the discussion, and not just take the coward’s route of criticizing other peoples’ ideas without putting some of my own out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, I think there’s a pretty large kernel of truth to the general idea of “effective reps.” I think the “hard” version of the idea (“the last 5 reps before failure are all the matters”) has major problems, but a “soft” version of the idea is almost self-evidently true. To maximize hypertrophy on a per-set basis, you do almost certainly have to get &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; close to failure, in basically any context I can think of. If you can do 12 reps with a certain weight, doing 3 sets of 10 is almost guaranteed to get you more growth than doing 3 sets of 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think the “effective reps” model works quite well when dealing with single-joint exercises, and especially exercises where the most difficult part isn’t the stretched position. I absolutely agree that tension is the primary factor in play, but I’m not so confident that the tension generated by individual fibers is all that matters. Since the proteins that kick off the hypertrophy cascade are located around the adhesion points between muscle fibers and the surrounding matrix of connective tissue, tension of the connective tissue matrix pulling on the fiber should have a similar effect as tension on the fiber pulling on the connective tissue matrix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button&quot; id=&quot;note-2-49459&quot; data-footnote-number=&quot;2&quot; data-footnote-identifier=&quot;2&quot; alt=&quot;See Footnote 2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; data-bigfoot-footnote=&quot;&lt;p&gt; There’s actually some evidence for this. A&lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apha.13336&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt; recent study in mice&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;i&gt;tension&lt;/i&gt; on the muscle itself, rather than active contractile tension, was what triggered hypertrophic signalling (by comparing stretch versus eccentric contractions). There’s also&lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28138986&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt; evidence for stretch-induced hypertrophy in humans&lt;/a&gt;, in a study where steps were taken to ensure there was no active muscular contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/button&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/effective-reps/#footnote-2-49459&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. That’s especially relevant when you’re dealing with an exercise like a bench press where, for instance, passive tension from stretching the pecs and active tension from contracting the pecs are both high at the bottom of a rep, creating additive tension that all fibers will “feel.” However, in an exercise like a knee extension or a biceps curl, the hardest part of the lift doesn’t coincide with a stretched position for the target muscle. In that case, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; relying almost entirely on active tension. I think it’s entirely plausible that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to take a standard biceps curl to failure to maximize growth, and that you’re basically wasting your time from a hypertrophy perspective if you’re more than a handful of reps from failure, but I also think it’s entirely plausible that you don’t have to take a squat or bench press as close to failure to get a robust growth response. It should be noted that of the two studies on single-joint training that &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; find more growth when going closer to failure, one (Sampson) &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; still include one weekly set to failure in the non-failure groups, and the other (Nóbrega) &lt;em&gt;basically&lt;/em&gt; had all conditions go to failure (since the “voluntary interruption” conditions just meant stopping just before you actually failed a rep). In the two remaining studies on single-joint training where there was a large, persistent difference in proximity to failure (Goto and Martorelli), going to failure caused more than three times as much growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also skeptical that maximizing per-fiber tension is all that important. My hunch is that the relationship between fiber tension and hypertrophy is somewhat logarithmic, with a plateau at a reasonably high (but not maximal) level of tension. We frequently see that the fibers associated with high threshold motor units grow just fine in response to training, but I’m skeptical that highest threshold MUs ever reach maximal tension unless you’re doing maximal isometrics or a true 1RM attempt (again, referring to the&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005581&quot;&gt; Potvin model&lt;/a&gt; from earlier). We also see that type II fibers&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174923&quot;&gt; seem to respond about as well&lt;/a&gt; to low-load training as high-load training, and I’m quite confident that, while the highest threshold MUs are recruited when going to failure during low-load training, they never reach anything approaching maximal tension. So, I do think that MU recruitment is an important factor to consider for growth, but I think that the growth-promoting effects of mechanical tension can be realized with per-fiber tensions that don’t necessarily need to approach maximal tension; otherwise, we’d be leaving a ton of growth for our highest threshold MUs on the table by neglecting maximal isometrics, which I don’t find particularly likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think people have written off metabolic stress a bit prematurely when scheming up hypertrophy models. Although the mechanisms by which mechanical tension lead to growth are better-characterized, that doesn’t mean there aren’t direct avenues for metabolic stress to promote hypertrophy that we just haven’t fully fleshed out yet. For example,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034463&quot;&gt; this study&lt;/a&gt; has been rolling around in my brain; it found that “constant tension” training for the triceps caused more growth than training through a longer range of motion, potentially due to greater muscle deoxygenation (it found pretty strong correlations between hypertrophy and pre- and post-training muscle deoxygenation caused by the workouts). In a similar vein,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24690432&quot;&gt; this study&lt;/a&gt; found that training in hypoxic conditions led to more hypertrophy than training under conditions of normal oxygen exposure. We also&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6144450/&quot;&gt; recently saw&lt;/a&gt; the first evidence that lactate can directly trigger the pathway that initiates muscle protein synthesis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; (albeit in mice). A&lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP278056&quot;&gt; recent study by Morton et al.&lt;/a&gt; also found that hypertrophic signalling was associated with the change (reduction) in glycogen levels resulting from training. I’m also struck by the couple of studies that have found pretty large increases in hypertrophy with the addition of a single lighter set (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15574075&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-015-3150-8&quot;&gt; two&lt;/a&gt;); I’m not sure how a purely tension-based accounting of hypertrophy can accommodate those findings. Regardless of the exact mechanism, a predictive model for hypertrophy seems like it needs some sort of fatigue term in it. Since the ability to generate tension decreases set-to-set, some aspect or byproduct of fatigue seems like it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; contribute to hypertrophy; otherwise, I’m not sure how you could account for the very robust finding that multiple sets of resistance exercise cause more growth than single sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/OoSfttthRKW4tepgqcp6_Goto-Figure-5.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;Association between pre- and post-training training-induced muscle deoxygenation and hypertrophy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that irks me a bit about the current literature on the effects of proximity to failure is that we can’t separate out the effects of training status from the effects of multi-joint versus single-joint training. My hunch is that training status matters, though. I don’t think well-trained lifters need to go as close to failure as untrained lifters in order to maximize the hypertrophic stimulus of a set. One adaptation to heavy resistance training is that&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jospt.org/doi/pdf/10.2519/jospt.1990.12.6.248&quot;&gt; synchronous recruitment of motor units improves&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, from the first rep of a set, you can “switch on” more motor units. Due to improvements in synchronous recruitment, I think it’s likely that trained lifters can reach the point of essentially full motor unit recruitment earlier in a set than untrained lifters do, (especially when&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095625&quot;&gt; trying to lift explosively&lt;/a&gt;). Furthermore, I think trained lifters can induce more metabolic fatigue on a per-rep basis than untrained lifters when training at the same percentage of their max. Energy demands of training&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-015-3150-8&quot;&gt; scale with work rate&lt;/a&gt;, so if you double the weight on the bar, you roughly double the energy demands. However, mitochondrial density&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605648/#s3title&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t increase&lt;/a&gt; with resistance training (though mitochondrial function may improve a bit), nor does capillary density (measured as capillaries per unit of muscle cross-sectional area, though there’s sometimes an increase in capillaries per fiber). So, energy demands go up, but the ability to meet those demands aerobically doesn’t change too much (certainly not at the same rate that strength increases), meaning the anaerobic contributions to energy expenditure increase, promoting greater metabolic fatigue on a per-rep or per-set basis. Thus, a model of hypertrophy with both a tension term and a fatigue term would predict that more highly trained lifters wouldn’t need to go quite as close to failure to accrue the necessary tension and fatigue to cause hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if I had to propose a model, I think tension is the initiator of hypertrophy, and some aspect of fatigue amplifies that signal (maybe it’s just lactate, maybe it’s some other protein or molecule produced under fatiguing conditions that senses deoxygenation or glycogen depletion, or maybe it’s something else entirely). I also think both of these factors have pretty reasonable thresholds, such that more tension promotes more hypertrophy up to a certain level, but you don’t need maximal tension on each fiber to maximize hypertrophy, and that more fatigue promotes more hypertrophy up to a certain level, but you don’t need maximal fatigue to maximize hypertrophy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button&quot; id=&quot;note-3-49459&quot; data-footnote-number=&quot;3&quot; data-footnote-identifier=&quot;3&quot; alt=&quot;See Footnote 3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; data-bigfoot-footnote=&quot;&lt;p&gt; This would make sense of &lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29564973&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt;the finding&lt;/a&gt; that intensity &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be too low to maximize hypertrophy, and the decent body of literature (&lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160627&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941492&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29910312&amp;quot; data-wpel-link=&amp;quot;external&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; rel=&amp;quot;external noopener noreferrer&amp;quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;) finding that hypertrophy seems to plateau after pretty moderate per-session volumes. Once tension is high &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; and you induce &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; fatigue, adding more tension or fatigue doesn’t do much for you. Both tension and fatigue working synergistically would explain why heavy singles or doubles probably don’t cause much growth: if the “important” fatigue is at all metabolic in nature, you’d be hard-pressed to induce it with super low rep sets.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;svg class=&quot;bigfoot-footnote__button__circle&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 6 6&quot; preserveAspectRatio=&quot;xMinYMin&quot;&gt;&lt;circle r=&quot;3&quot; cx=&quot;3&quot; cy=&quot;3&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; &lt;/button&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/effective-reps/#footnote-3-49459&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. However, I think the details of how those factors play out in training depends on context. Are you dealing with trained lifters (who will be able to recruit motor units and generate tension more efficiently) or untrained lifters (who will have a harder time generating tension)? Are you dealing with an exercise where the muscles are maximally challenged in a stretched position, or an exercise where virtually all of the tension comes from active contraction? Are you dealing with a single joint exercise where you may need to go pretty close to failure to get close to full MU recruitment of the muscle you’re trying to train, or a multi-joint exercise where your target muscle may get close to full recruitment further from failure? I don’t think this idea is fundamentally different from “effective reps.” On the contrary, getting within 5 reps of failure does ensure that tension will be quite high, and doing a fair amount of reps during a training session that are pretty close to failure is bound to generate quite a bit of fatigue. However, as I hope is clear by now, the “hard” version of effective reps (only worrying about reps that occur within 5 reps of failure) misses out on a fair bit of nuance, and doesn’t track that well with the experimental evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

Proposed model of hypertrophy. Thick arrow = causal relationship. Thin arrow = influence or enhancement.  Within this model, there is assumed to be threshold for both tension and fatigue/metabolic stress at which hypertrophy is maximized, but neither maximal tension nor maximal fatigue/metabolic stress are assumed to be necessary to maximize hypertrophy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note to wrap things up, I want to reiterate that I’m not trying to call Chris out, or anything of that nature. As I mentioned, his ideas about hypertrophy are quite thorough and well-researched with a considerable amount of depth, and I’d highly recommend you check out his stuff. I mostly just wanted to critique the overly simplified version of his “effective reps” idea that the internet hivemind has latched onto. And again, I want to make clear that I’m not trying to imply that the “hard,” simplified version of his “effective reps” model is the entirety of what he actually believes about hypertrophy. Several of his articles are linked below; most of these discuss effective reps, but he has a lot of great stuff on his&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@SandCResearch&quot;&gt; Medium profile&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/&quot;&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, trained men were split into 4 groups and trained the squat for 8 weeks. All groups performed the same number of sets, but reps per set were dictated using velocity loss thresholds. The thresholds were 0% (e.g. sets of just 1 rep), 10%, 20%, and 40%. The group training with a 40% velocity loss for each set therefore performed way more reps than any other group, and also performed far more reps that were close to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the group training with a 20% velocity loss actually experienced (non-significantly) more quad hypertrophy than the group training with a 40% velocity loss (7% vs. 5.3%). The groups that stopped each set WAY far from failure (0% and 10% velocity loss) experienced less quad growth (2.2% and 2.1%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.termedia.pl/Effect-of-resistance-training-to-muscle-failure-vs-non-failure-on-strength-hypertrophy-and-muscle-architecture-in-trained-individuals,78,40974,0,1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect of resistance training to muscle failure vs non-failure on strength, hypertrophy and muscle architecture in trained individuals&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Santanielo et al. (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, trained men’s legs were split into two conditions, and performed unilateral leg press and unilateral knee extensions for 10 weeks, using a within-subject design. In one condition, one leg trained to failure on every set, and for the other condition, subjects were instructed to “voluntarily interrupt” their sets shy of failure. Subjects performed the same number of sets with both legs, averaging 12 reps per set in the failure condition and 10.6 reps per set in the voluntary interruption condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertrophy didn’t differ significantly between groups, but tended to be greater in the voluntary interruption condition. Vastus lateralis CSA increased by 13.5% when training to failure, and 18.1% when stopping all sets shy of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.13775&quot;&gt;Effects of velocity loss in the bench press exercise on strength gains, neuromuscular adaptations and muscle hypertrophy.&lt;/a&gt; Pareja-Blanco et al. (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of this study was virtually identical to the other recent Pareja-Blanco study, except that the subjects were training the bench press instead of the squat, pec growth was assessed instead of quad growth, and the velocity loss thresholds were 0%, 15%, 25%, and 50% instead of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the other Pareja-Blanco study, the group training closest to failure (50% velocity loss) didn’t grow &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as the group stopping a bit further from failure (25% velocity loss), though the difference wasn’t significant: 20.3% vs. 16.5%. Furthermore, the two groups stopping even further from failure (0% and 15% velocity loss) did not experience as much growth: 8.7% and 11.8%. Honestly, I’m a bit surprised that the 0% velocity loss group experienced any hypertrophy at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untrained lifters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2020/05000/Is_Performing_Repetitions_to_Failure_Less.6.aspx&quot;&gt;Is Performing Repetitions to Failure Less Important Than Volume for Muscle Hypertrophy and Strength?&lt;/a&gt; Lacerda et al. (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untrained subjects trained for 14 weeks, performing knee extensions using a within-subject unilateral design. One leg performed 3-4 sets to failure, and the other leg matched the training volume for the failure leg, while performing an equal number of reps per set. The failure leg ended up performing all sets to failure (by design), while the non-failure leg typically had about 2 reps in reserve on the first set, 1 reps in reserve on the second set, and 0 reps in reserve (e.g. they didn’t fail, but they wouldn’t have been able to perform another rep) on the 3rd/4th set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There weren’t significant differences between groups, but the leg that didn’t train to failure for the first 2 sets tended to grow more than the failure leg. Rectus femoris CSA increased by 20.11% in the non-failure condition versus 15.89% in the failure condition, and vastus lateralis CSA increased by 21.3% in the non-failure condition versus 15.06% in the failure condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Muscle_Failure_Promotes_Greater_Muscle_Hypertrophy.94591.aspx&quot;&gt;Muscle Failure Promotes Greater Muscle Hypertrophy in Low-Load but Not in High-Load Resistance Training.&lt;/a&gt; Lasevicius et al. (2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study compared 2 groups, split into 4 conditions, over 8 weeks of training. One group trained unilateral knee extensions with 80% of 1RM, and one group trained unilateral knee extensions with 30% of 1RM. Within each group, there was a failure and a non-failure condition. The failure leg performed 3 sets to failure in every workout, and the non-failure leg performed sets of 60% as many reps as the failure leg, until volume load was matched between legs (in other words, the non-failure leg performed approximately 5 sets). In the 80% group, the failure leg averaged 12.4 reps per set while the non-failure leg averaged 6.7, and in the 30% group, the non-failure leg averaged 34.4 reps per set while the non-failure leg averaged 19.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quad growth was comparable in both conditions for the group training at 80% of 1RM (8.1% in the failure condition and 7.7% in the non-failure condition). However, quad growth was considerably greater in the 30% leg that trained to failure (7.8% for the failure leg vs. 2.8% for the non-failure leg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/9000/Low_Load_Resistance_Training_to_Volitional_Failure.94325.aspx&quot;&gt;Low-Load Resistance Training to Volitional Failure Induces Muscle Hypertrophy Similar to Volume-Matched, Velocity Fatigue.&lt;/a&gt; Terada et al. (2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, untrained lifters trained the bench press for 8 weeks. Subjects were split into 3 groups. One group trained with 40% of 1RM for 3 sets to failure in each workout, one group trained with 40% of 1RM for 3 sets dictated by velocity (non-failure), and one group trained with 80% of 1RM for 3 sets that were basically to failure. For the 40% non-failure group, subjects completed reps until their velocity dipped 20% below the average velocity of their first 10 reps. They didn’t train to failure, but I think they got fairly close to it. They averaged 34.1 reps on their first set, 21.1 reps on their second set, and 16.9 reps on their 3rd set, compared to 40.4, 19.1, and 15.3 in the failure group. For the 80% group, the text of the study says they were supposed to complete 8 reps per set, but the subjects averaged fewer than 8 reps on all sets (7.7 for set 1, 7.5 for set 2, and 6.3 for set 3), so it’s probable that all of the subjects ended up training to failure on all or most of their sets. Thus, in effect, there were two failure conditions (40% to failure and 80% to failure), and one near-failure condition (40% non-failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triceps and pec growth didn’t differ significantly between groups, but tended to be greatest in the 40% failure group. Triceps CSA increased by 16.8% in the 40% failure group, 10.9% in the 80% failure group, and 7.7% in the 40% non-failure group. Pec CSA increased by 21.3% in the 40% failure group, 14.5% in the 80% failure group, and 15.7% in the 40% non-failure group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In analyzing these studies, all three of the studies on trained lifters failed to support the idea of training to failure. They all matched the number of sets performed, and a group training a bit further from failure (20% and 25% velocity loss in the two Pareja-Blanco studies, and “voluntary interruption” in the Santanielo study) grew non-significantly more than a group training close to failure (40% and 50% velocity loss in the two Pareja-Blanco studies, and the failure condition in the Santanielo study). However, unsurprisingly, stopping each set REALLY far from failure did compromise hypertrophy. The groups training with velocity losses of 0-15% generally grew less than the groups training with velocity losses of 20%+ in the Pareja-Blanco studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies on untrained lifters were a bit of a mixed bag. Lacerda and Terada both essentially compared failure vs. near-failure conditions. Terada found non-significant differences in favor of going to failure, while Lacerda found non-significant differences in favor of stopping a bit shy of failure. These two studies are essentially a wash. The Lasevicius study was interesting, because the non-failure condition with 80% produced as much growth as the failure condition with 80%, even though the non-failure condition should have resulted in basically no “effective reps” (the non-failure condition averaged almost 6 fewer reps per set). However, the non-failure condition with 80% would have still been reasonably challenging training, especially since the subjects did a couple of extra sets to compensate for the fact that the number of reps per set was lower. However, the non-failure condition with 30% produced way less growth than the failure condition, probably because the legs in the failure condition were training with almost 15 reps in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these studies support the idea that in order to maximize growth on a per-set basis, you do need to be reasonably close to failure, but actually reaching failure probably isn’t necessary, especially for trained lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added these studies into the previous analysis, and they didn’t really move the needle for trained lifters, but they did cause a bit of a shift for untrained lifters. With these studies added in, failure training now appears to produce about 40% more growth than non-failure training for untrained lifters; it was nearly a 2-fold difference before. As a note, I only added the 20% vs. 40% and the 25% vs. 50% comparisons from the Pareja-Blanco studies into the analysis, since I can’t imagine there are many people performing singles at 70% of 1RM and treating it as hypertrophy training.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The First Clear Evidence of Delayed Hypertrophic Supercompensation</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/delayedhypertrophy/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The idea of delayed hypertrophic supercompensation – the idea that your muscles can keep growing for several days after you complete a grueling block of training – is very contentious. A recent study provides us with the first evidence that it’s possible. However, there’s quite a bit more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is a review and breakdown of a recent study. The study reviewed is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30543499&quot;&gt;Delayed Myonuclear Addition, Myofiber Hypertrophy and Increases in Strength with High-Frequency Low-Load Blood Flow Restricted Training to Volitional Failure &lt;/a&gt;by Bjørnsen et al. (2018)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-points&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This study had untrained subjects complete two blocks of high-frequency blood flow restriction training, with 10 days between blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength and muscle fiber cross-sectional area both appeared to follow a pattern of delayed supercompensation. Muscle fiber CSA decreased at first, and then increased until at least 10 days after the last session was completed. Maximal knee extension strength increased until at least 20 days after the last session was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, muscle fiber CSA and whole muscle size followed different patterns of adaptation. Whole muscle size didn’t decrease initially, and it didn’t keep increasing after the training was completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently reviewed a study from Bjørnsen and colleagues with some interesting findings: Just two weeks of low-load training with blood flow restriction (BFR) caused really robust hypertrophy of type I fibers, providing the clearest evidence we have for fiber type-specific hypertrophy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188363&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). The same group is back with another eye-catching study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30543499&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), potentially demonstrating delayed hypertrophic supercompensation for the first time. Delayed supercompensation is the idea that beneficial adaptations can keep occurring after a period of training is completed. It’s most often discussed in the context of overreaching: You train beyond your normal capacities for a time, but after several days of rest, you rapidly accrue beneficial adaptations. Most people think about delayed supercompensation from a performance perspective, and several theories of tapering and peaking are built around this idea. However, delayed hypertrophic supercompensation is much more controversial; the traditional view is that muscles stop growing when you stop training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, untrained subjects completed two five-day blocks of high-frequency, low-load training with blood flow restriction. The researchers measured maximal knee extension strength, muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and whole-muscle CSAs and thicknesses. While measures of whole muscle size increased quickly and potentially decreased a bit after the cessation of training (probably due to a reduction in swelling), muscle fiber CSAs and knee extension strength kept increasing long after the second block of training finished. The continued increase in fiber CSA and discordance between changes in fiber size and whole muscle size are very interesting and certainly worth a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;purpose-and-hypotheses&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose and Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#purpose-and-hypotheses&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#purpose&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to “investigate the effects of two blocks with high frequency blood flow restricted resistance exercise, separated by 10 days of rest, on fiber and whole muscle areas, myonuclear and satellite cell numbers and muscle strength, and the time courses of those changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;hypotheses&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#hypotheses&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous research (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802591&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), hypertrophy due to high-frequency BFR training plateaued after seven days of training. It was hypothesized that the 10-day rest period between training blocks would reset the subjects’ responsiveness to the anabolic stimuli so that they’d experience hypertrophy, increases in satellite cell number, and myonuclear accretion during both blocks of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;subjects-and-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjects and Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#subjects-and-methods&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 recreationally active adults with no resistance training experience participated in this study. Three subjects dropped out over the course of the study, so 13 subjects were included in the final analyses. Further details about the subjects can be seen in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Table-1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;study-overview&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Study Overview&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#study-overview&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole study took place over 46 days for each participant. One week before training began, the subjects underwent baseline testing, including assessments of quad muscle size and strength, a blood draw, and a muscle biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training itself consisted of two blocks of high-frequency, low-load knee extensions with BFR. Each block lasted for five days. During the first three days of each block, the subjects trained once per day, and they trained twice per day during the last two days of each block (accomplishing seven workouts in five days). For all sessions, the subjects performed four sets of blood flow restricted unilateral knee extensions to failure with each leg, with 20% of 1RM and 30 seconds between sets. All four sets were completed on the right leg first, followed by four sets with the left leg. The pressure cuff used to achieve blood flow restriction (inflated to 90mmHg for women and 100mmHg for men) was left on between sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects had a 10-day break between the two blocks of training, and follow-up measures were assessed at 3, 5, 10, and 20 days following the second training block. The authors assessed strength using 1RM knee extensions; they assessed hypertrophy with ultrasound scans, muscle biopsies, and MRIs; and they performed blood draws to measure blood markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase and myoglobin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a schematic of this study, see Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Figure-1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#findings&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training loads didn’t change over the course of the study, but rep performance increased. The subjects completed 80 ± 14 reps per session during the first block, and 89 ± 13 reps per session during the second block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markers of muscle damage were significantly elevated during the first block of training, went back to baseline during the rest week, and then did not increase significantly above baseline during the second block of training. Soreness (assessed via a visual analog scale) peaked during the third day of the first block, whereas creatine kinase and myoglobin peaked on the last day of the first block of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Figure-2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle fiber CSA significantly &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; at first. The decrease was larger in type II fibers (-15% during the rest period) than type I fibers (-6% during the first block of training). After the initial decrease in fiber CSA, fiber size increased throughout the rest of the study. It was back around baseline for both fiber types three days after the last training session and was elevated above baseline 10 days post-training (+19% for type I, and +11% for type II). The difference from baseline at 10 days post-training was significant for type I fibers (p=0.01), but not quite significant for type II fibers (p=0.09).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Figure-3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypertrophy estimates from ultrasound scans tell a very different story. Rectus femoris CSA and vastus lateralis thickness increased significantly above baseline by the end of the first block of training (+6.8% and +5.6%, respectively), trended back toward baseline measures during the 10-day rest period (down to 1.5% and 3.4% above baseline), increased significantly again by the end of the second training block (up to 7.9% and 6.9% above baseline), and stayed elevated above baseline (decreasing non-significantly to 7.0% and 5.7% above baseline) during the 10 days following the last training session. MRI scans were only taken at baseline and five days post-training, but rectus femoris CSA, vastus lateralis CSA, and total quadriceps CSA all significantly increased as well. However, the relative increases tended to be smaller than those seen with either the ultrasound scans or the biopsies (+6.2% for rectus femoris CSA, +2.4% for vastus lateralis CSA, and +1.2% for quadriceps CSA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Figure-4.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like fiber CSA, 1RM knee extension strength initially decreased slightly, though significantly (-4%), from baseline to the rest period. Strength did not significantly differ from baseline at 3 and 10 days post-training, but was significantly elevated 20 days post-training (+6%). However, the total swing in mean strength was very modest, from 65kg at baseline, to 63kg during the rest period, to 69kg 20 days post-training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Supercompensation-Figure-5.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite cells per muscle fiber increased quickly in both fiber types (by ~70% in type I fibers and ~50% in type II fibers by day four of the first block of training). That increase more or less leveled off for type I fibers (peaking at an increase of 96% three days post-training), but satellite cells per type II fiber increased progressively (peaking at an increase of 144% 10 days post-training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both fiber types, myonuclei per fiber didn’t increase between baseline and the rest week. However, myonuclei per fiber then increased following the second training block, peaking at 10 days post-training for both fiber types (+30% for type I fibers, and +31% for type II fibers). Interestingly, myonuclear domain tended to decrease in both fiber types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is a research review for strength athletes and coaches, I won’t belabor the cellular signaling markers, except to say that the pattern of gene expression looked to be most in favor of anabolism 10 days post-training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few interesting things about these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, as a word of caution, one of the subjects had to withdraw from the study during the first block of training with symptoms that looked like the possible onset of rhabdomyolysis (pain, extreme weakness, and huge elevations in creatine kinase). More generally, the subjects had large increases in creatine kinase, myoglobin, and soreness during the first block. This stands in opposition to the popular idea that low-load training with blood flow restriction causes minimal muscle damage (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650102&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). However, it seems like the devil is in the details. &lt;em&gt;Most&lt;/em&gt; early blood flow restriction studies had people perform sets of 30, 15, 15, and 15 reps with a load equal to 30% of 1RM. Even with blood flow restriction, 30 reps at 30% of 1RM will be well shy of failure, and you may not hit failure until the last set with the 30/15/15/15 protocol (if you hit failure at all). The majority of the research using this rep scheme finds little to no muscle damage with low-load blood flow restricted training, even with untrained subjects. However, it seems that low-load blood flow restriction training &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cause substantial muscle damage if all sets are taken to failure (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19727801&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762334&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;). On a related note, this study also demonstrates the outcomes of the repeated bout effect (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27782911&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;). During the first block of training, the subjects experienced increases in soreness and substantial elevations in myoglobin and creatine kinase. During the second block of training (after just seven prior exposures to that style of training), there were no elevations in any of the markers of muscle damage assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to parse the actual training outcomes of this study. A simple takeaway is that this study beautifully demonstrated training specificity. Strength endurance (total reps completed during each session) increased by a bit over 10% from the first block to the second block of training. However, maximal strength didn’t significantly increase between baseline testing and the 1RM test that occurred three days after the end of the second block of training. The training loads were very light, so they were effective at increasing strength endurance, but didn’t do much for maximal strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximal strength findings are a bit confusing. Maximal knee extension strength didn’t significantly increase over baseline values until &lt;em&gt;20 days&lt;/em&gt; after the last training session. On one hand, you could interpret that as a delayed supercompensation effect. On the other hand, we could just be seeing the effect of learning the test. The subjects were familiarized at the start of the study, but since the subjects were untrained, they still hadn’t done many maximal knee extensions in their lives by the time the second block of training wrapped up. Simply having a few more sessions to learn the test could explain the modest increase in maximal strength (~6%), especially in these untrained subjects. I think that’s especially likely since strength wasn’t significantly elevated at 10 days post-training. The training protocol in this study was certainly challenging, but I just can’t imagine that it was grueling enough that fatigue wouldn’t have dissipated after 10 days of rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike maximal strength, muscle fiber size &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; seem to undergo delayed supercompensation. Between 3 and 10 days post-training, the CSAs of both fiber types increased by more than 10%. As noted, the anabolic signaling milieu (i.e. decreased p21 abundance and increase myogenin and cyclin D2 abundance) seemed to be the most favorable for hypertrophy at 10 days post-training, so that may contribute. As we learned in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massmember.com/products/mass-subscription/categories/603578/posts/1968781&quot;&gt;previous issue of MASS&lt;/a&gt;, training, detraining, and retraining also causes epigenetic changes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20287-3&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;) that seem to be favorable for hypertrophy. That may contribute as well. However, it’s still very interesting, and I’m not sure that those two potential explanations can fully explain these results. As far as I’m aware, this is the first study showing this type of delayed hypertrophic supercompensation following resistance training. I’d love to see these results replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to note that whole-muscle hypertrophy and fiber hypertrophy displayed very different patterns. Early on, whole muscle size (thickness or CSA) increased, while fiber CSA decreased. During the actual training phases, the increases in whole muscle size were likely at least partially due to local swelling (edema). However, whole muscle size tended to still be elevated above baseline four days into the rest period between training blocks (which should have been enough time for edema to dissipate), and it tended to decrease slightly between the end of the second training block and 10 days post-training. Because of that, I doubt the delayed supercompensation of fiber size would matter much to a physique athlete. If your muscle fibers are growing a bit, but the whole muscle isn’t changing in size, I doubt that would really affect your appearance of muscularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the different hypertrophy assessments came to different conclusions is intriguing. As mentioned, the time course of gains was completely different; however, the magnitude of changes was different as well. By 10 days post-training, average fiber CSA had increased by ~15%, whereas the change in whole muscle size was closer to 6-7%. This is similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/extreme-volume-study/&quot;&gt;recent study by Haun et al&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2018.00084/full&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;), where different hypertrophy measures again painted substantially different pictures. At this point, I’m not sure what we can do with that information, but I’d like to see more research investigating the disconnect between changes in fiber size and changes in whole muscle size. One possibility is just that the fibers that are biopsied are not representative of the fibers in the muscle as a whole (possibly due to regional hypertrophy). Muscle swelling should affect whole-muscle size more than fiber size as well. However, I’d bet that there’s more to the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, it’s important to note the variability in individual responses. Type I fiber size increased by ~50% in one subject, while decreasing by ~5% in two subjects. The same is true of type II fibers. One individual saw an increase slightly exceeding 40%, while another individual saw a decrease in excess of 10%. As for strength, one individual got about 8% weaker, while another individual got about 15% stronger. In this study, as with any study, don’t blindly assume that everyone gets results that are tightly clustered around the mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study noted that the satellite cell response in this study was larger than the satellite cell response typically seen in untrained subjects doing conventional, heavier resistance training. However, the increase wasn’t as large as the increase previously seen in another low-load blood flow restriction study (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802591&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). The authors speculate that differences in training stress could explain the difference. The subjects in this study trained to true failure, whereas the authors of the prior study noted that they didn’t push their subjects quite as hard for their first few training sessions. The authors of the present study proposed that the muted satellite cell response and the initial decreases in both fiber size and strength may have been due to simply pushing their subjects past the point they could truly recover from during the first block of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s interesting to note that we may be seeing preferential type I fiber growth again in this study, as the increase in type I fiber size (19%) tended to be a bit larger than the increase in type II fiber size (11%). A previous paper from this same research group involving low-load blood flow restriction training in powerlifters provided the first strong evidence (in my opinion) for fiber type-specific hypertrophy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188363&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). However, I’m less sold that we’re seeing fiber type-specific hypertrophy in this study. Fiber CSA of both fiber types increased by about the same amount between the 10-day rest period and 10 days post-training. The difference was that, during the initial training block, type II fibers &lt;em&gt;atrophied&lt;/em&gt; more. So, maybe you could make a case for fiber type-specific &lt;em&gt;atrophy&lt;/em&gt;, but I’m less sold on the premise of preferential type I growth in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some people will read this review and get fired up to try an overreaching block. After all, we now have some direct evidence for delayed supercompensation, which is the idea that overreaching blocks are built on. However, I’d be wary of that interpretation. For starters, the total strength gains in this study weren’t anything to write home about, and whole muscle size didn’t show delayed supercompensation. More importantly, we can’t know if the delayed supercompensation (likely due to overreaching) allowed the subjects to make larger gains, in total, compared to non-overreaching training. For example, fiber size initially decreased, and then increased dramatically between the 10-day rest period and 10 days post-training, including a pretty large increase between 3 days post-training and 10 days post-training. If you just pay attention to the actual period of delayed supercompensation, the results are impressive indeed: Fiber CSA increased by around 1% per day, which is an insane rate of progress. However, it’s very possible that these subjects would have grown more, in total, had they not overreached and experienced a bit of atrophy during and following the first part of the study. Without clear evidence of better results with overreaching, it seems like a high risk (increasing your odds of overtraining, and potentially increasing your injury risk) strategy with an unclear (likely small, at best) payoff. Finally, it’s clear that delayed supercompensation isn’t fully understood. Maybe it happens in trained subjects after moderate-to-heavy loading, or maybe it’s a phenomenon that could only occur in new lifters training at very low intensities. There’s just a lot that we don’t yet know about delayed supercompensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, some of the results of this study could be used to argue for the efficacy of occasional blocks of high-frequency, low-load blood flow restriction training for people interested in maximizing hypertrophy. As we learned previously (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188363&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), low-load, high-rep front squats with blood flow restriction can cause impressive quad growth in powerlifters after just two one-week blocks. The authors of the present study note that low-load training with BFR leads to a larger satellite cell response than is typically seen with traditional, heavier training, and the decrease in myonuclear domain size hints at the possibility that the subjects in this study were primed for future growth. Myonuclear domains tend to increase initially with training (up to a relatively fixed point, called the myonuclear domain limit), as fiber CSA initially increases faster than new myonuclei can be added (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713720&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;). Hypertrophy is generally easier when lifters’ fibers are below their myonuclear domain limit, so a decrease in myonuclear domain size suggests that the subjects in this study were primed for additional rapid growth. However, the same caveat applies: We don’t know if we’d see the same myonuclear domain outcomes in well-trained lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#next-steps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see these results replicated in trained lifters, specifically the delayed supercompensation of fiber size. I’d also love to see changes in muscle protein subfractions during and after a block of training. Maybe contractile proteins initially increase during training, and then structural and metabolic proteins increase after training cessation to support the increase in contractile proteins (i.e. myofibrillar hypertrophy followed by sarcoplasmic hypertrophy), or maybe structural and metabolic proteins increase initially to meet the initial demands of training, followed by contractile proteins (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy followed by myofibrillar hypertrophy). Finally, I’d like to see a comparison of “concentrated” training like this (two blocks of seven session in five days) that likely caused acute overreaching compared to more dispersed training (maybe those same 14 sessions spread over 28 days). I think strength gains would be greater with the dispersed training, but it’s possible that concentrating training could be beneficial for hypertrophy, as a way to overload the muscles enough to force adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;application-and-takeaways&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application and Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#application-and-takeaways&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m wary of extracting any concrete takeaways from this study, since we don’t know whether the results would generalize to the type of training most MASS readers would be doing. However, we do now know that delayed hypertrophic supercompensation is at least possible, which is something that was debatable (and that I was personally doubtful of) before this study.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Without question, creatine is the gold standard by which all strength-related supplements are judged. The basic premise for how and why creatine works so well is pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We store creatine in our muscles. A phosphate group can be easily attached to creatine, thereby forming &lt;em&gt;phosphocreatine&lt;/em&gt;, which is also stored in our muscles. When muscles do work, they use adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process of “using” ATP involves removing a phosphate group, which turns adenosine triphosphate (three phosphates) into adenosine diphosphate (two phosphates). Phosphocreatine swoops in to rapidly donate its phosphate group, ADP becomes ATP, and we’re ready to do more work in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-intensity exercise is characterized not only by the use of a large amount of total ATP, but more critically by its need for rapid access to ATP. Compared to rest, the rate of ATP demand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005844/&quot;&gt;increases up to 1,000-fold&lt;/a&gt; during intense exercise. If ATP isn’t available within a reasonably fast time frame, performance simply cannot be sustained, and intensity drops as a consequence. Phosphocreatine provides rapid ATP replenishment, but a muscle can only store so much creatine and phosphocreatine at a given time. In this sense, creatine can be thought of as a quantitatively limited, but fairly instantaneous, reservoir for the replenishment of ATP. The purpose of creatine supplementation is to increase the amount of stored creatine, thereby bolstering the capacity of this rapid ATP-generating energy system. In addition, creatine has been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12945830&quot;&gt;increase lean body mass&lt;/a&gt;, presumably due to increased intramuscular fluid retention and improved resistance training capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could spend the next 7,000 words recapping hundreds of studies showing that creatine increases strength and power output during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in healthy young adults. Fortunately, I won’t, because that stopped being interesting about 15 years ago. Instead, this article will explore some of the lesser-known aspects of creatine and address some of the most frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-performance-enhancing-mechanisms-of-creatine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Performance-Enhancing Mechanisms of Creatine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#other-performance-enhancing-mechanisms-of-creatine&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the rapid facilitation of ATP resynthesis is the primary and most straightforward ergogenic mechanism of creatine, there are two additional mechanisms that are less widely known and less frequently discussed. When ATP is used (hydrolyzed), it loses a phosphate group, but a hydrogen ion is also released in the process (Figure 1). Furthermore, anaerobic glycolysis is increased during high-intensity exercise, which further adds to the pool of hydrogen ions. During exercise, accumulation of hydrogen ions results in acidosis, which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8585477&quot;&gt;associated with&lt;/a&gt; the onset of fatigue. When phosphocreatine donates its phosphate group to reform ATP from ADP, a hydrogen ion is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005844/&quot;&gt;consumed in the process&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, hydrogen buffering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30682546&quot;&gt;might be a secondary mechanism&lt;/a&gt; by which creatine supplementation helps to delay fatigue during intense exercise. Without question, creatine’s direct role in ATP production is the major mechanism by which it improves high-intensity exercise. However, when studies show that creatine enhances short-term, high-intensity exercise that is likely to induce a great deal of acidosis within the muscle, it is possible that pH buffering is making a small contribution to this effect. Frankly, if you’re doing anything at high enough intensity to induce substantial acidosis, you should probably already be taking creatine for its ATP-recycling effects. Nonetheless, if this newfound knowledge of creatine’s pH buffering capacity is the final piece of information required to get you on board with the premise of creatine supplementation, then it is worth drawing attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;creatine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine has long been known to increase body mass. After only a week of creatine loading, body mass is often increased by 1-2kg, and this rapid increase is attributable to water retention. Creatine is osmolytic; this means that, similarly to glycogen, increased storage of muscle creatine draws water into the muscle cell. As such, short-term loading interventions often cause up to 1-2 liters of water retention. Aside from this water-induced weight gain, and aside from potential hypertrophic adaptations to creatine-induced improvements in training capacity, there is some evidence to suggest that creatine has some direct effects on muscle hypertrophy. As reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679696/&quot;&gt;Chilibeck et al&lt;/a&gt;, creatine may also promote increases in lean body mass by directly affecting myostatin, myogenic regulatory factors, insulin-like growth factor 1, reactive oxygen species, and satellite cell activation. Satellite cell activation is a key step in training-induced hypertrophy; when a muscle is exercised or injured, satellite cells increase the number of myonuclei in the muscle, which increase the muscle’s capacity for protein synthesis. A number of myogenic regulatory factors play a role in promoting satellite cell activation, whereas myostatin inhibits activation. Creatine is thought to directly increase the production of myogenic regulatory factors by increasing cellular swelling via intracellular water storage, and indirectly increase their production by increasing levels of insulin-like growth factor 1. Creatine has also been shown to decrease myostatin activity, thereby simultaneously promoting factors that increase satellite cell activation and inhibiting factors that reduce satellite cell activation. Finally, excessive production of reactive oxygen species promotes inflammation and atrophy; by scavenging reactive oxygen species, creatine has the potential to reduce oxidative stress and inhibit atrophy, ultimately facilitating muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When studies of considerable length (more than just a few weeks) document weight gain in response to creatine supplementation, this weight gain is sometimes written off as “just water weight” or exclusively attributed to creatine-induced improvements in training volume. Research would suggest that such conclusions fail to acknowledge the likelihood that creatine has more direct effects on promoting muscle hypertrophy, and they discount a mechanism that might contribute to creatine’s benefits for strength and power performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-type-of-creatine-is-best%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Type of Creatine is Best?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#which-type-of-creatine-is-best%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine monohydrate is the typical, “standard” form of creatine supplement. It was the first to hit the literature, it’s the most affordable, and it’s the most widely studied type of creatine to date. Literally hundreds of studies have shown creatine monohydrate to effectively increase muscle creatine storage and enhance physical performance. However, a wide variety of creatine variations have been evaluated in the search for the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; type of creatine. There is no shortage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080578/&quot;&gt;potential creatine variations&lt;/a&gt;, but the ones that have picked up the most steam &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; creatine citrate, creatine ethyl ester, creatine nitrate, and buffered forms of creatine. The quest for the best creatine serves as a case study that demonstrates two important concepts: don’t focus on mechanisms over outcomes, and don’t search for solutions until you find a problem. Every time a new form of creatine comes around, it comes with technical explanations of why it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; outperform creatine monohydrate. So far, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;none of them&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to consistently and substantially increase creatine retention, performance, or anything other than price, in comparison to creatine monohydrate. More importantly, these various creatine “solutions” seem to be addressing a non-problem. Creatine monohydrate is quite effective at saturating muscle creatine storage and increasing performance; even if a more effective type of creatine were to come along, it’s hard to imagine it’d do much beyond allowing slightly quicker saturation, a slightly higher (but physiologically irrelevant) degree of saturation, or saturation at a lower daily dose. Despite my skepticism, I’m always open to changing my mind if some incredible form of creatine comes along. But for now, creatine monohydrate is the most well-studied, effective, and affordable type of creatine on the market. If you are really concerned about fully maximizing creatine retention, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that the addition of carbohydrate (or carbohydrate + protein) improves retention a little bit, but (in my opinion) not enough to really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact type of creatine is not particularly important, the physical state (solid versus liquid) certainly is. Creatine monohydrate powder is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080578/&quot;&gt;remarkably stable&lt;/a&gt;; at a temperature of 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit), virtually no breakdown is observed over the course of three years. In storage temperatures as high as 60° Celsius (140° Fahrenheit), breakdown starts to be observed after 44 months of heat exposure. In contrast, creatine is quite unstable in liquid solution, especially in the context of high temperatures and/or low pH. Substantial creatine breakdown occurs after only a few days in liquid solutions, even in room-temperature solutions with fairly neutral pH levels. As a result, the best course of action would be to purchase creatine in solid (powder or capsule) form, store it in room temperature conditions (or colder), and consume it immediately after mixing it into a liquid solution. If you must mix the beverage hours before consuming it, using a non-acidic liquid would be preferred, and it should be stored at a cold temperature if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maximizing-muscle-creatine-saturation%3A-loading%2C-cycling%2C-and-timing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing Muscle Creatine Saturation: Loading, Cycling, and Timing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#maximizing-muscle-creatine-saturation%3A-loading%2C-cycling%2C-and-timing&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of creatine supplementation is to saturate muscle creatine storage, but there are two common methods for achieving saturation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-9-33&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/a&gt; is a popular method, which involves taking very high creatine doses (20-25 grams per day, split between 4-5 doses) for 4-7 days in a row. After this loading phase, muscle creatine storage is saturated, and a maintenance dose of 2-5 grams per day is taken thereafter. While loading is certainly effective, it is not necessarily required. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828669&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that moderate daily doses of 3 grams per day can saturate muscle creatine storage after about 3-4 weeks of supplementation (Figure 2). When deciding whether or not to load, the primary factors to consider are time and gastrointestinal comfort. If you really, really need your results to be maximized within seven days of supplementation, loading would be the way to go. However, mild gastrointestinal discomfort is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373286&quot;&gt;often observed&lt;/a&gt; with creatine supplementation; if your stomach struggles with taking in 20-25 grams of creatine over the course of a day, then loading would not be your best bet, and a more patient approach would be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;  &lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image3-e1551108121802.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.&quot;&gt;  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;figure-caption&quot;&gt;creatine supplementation protocol&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are pretty good at regulating things. For example, consider a healthy person that uses exogenous estrogen or testosterone; in both cases, administration of these hormones causes inhibition of the feedback loop that promotes their endogenous production. As a result, some have argued that creatine supplementation might suppress endogenous creatine production and should be cycled to prevent long-term downregulation of creatine production. It is true that supplementation with typical doses of creatine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11356982&quot;&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; short-term production of creatine. However, this is not necessarily a problem if endogenous production recovers after the cessation of supplementation. After all, there is no need to continue producing a great deal of creatine when you’ve got 5 grams (or more) coming in every day. Fortunately, endogenous production kicks right back in when you stop taking creatine, and studies have found &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that long-term creatine supplementation impairs creatine production after supplementation has ceased. In this sense, the only reasons to cycle creatine would be that you’re tired of reminding yourself it take it every day, or you don’t feel like spending the money to replenish your creatine stash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final dosing consideration with creatine pertains to the time at which creatine is ingested. Countless studies have shown creatine to be efficacious with a wide range of supplement timing approaches. There are very few studies (three, to be precise) directly comparing the effects of pre-exercise creatine supplementation to post-exercise supplementation. The results of these three studies were combined in a small meta-analysis. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328075908_Timing_of_Creatine_Supplementation_and_Resistance_Training_A_Brief_Review&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; suggested that post-exercise supplementation may lead to slightly greater increases in fat-free mass, with no significant difference observed for effects on strength. The body of literature on this topic is extremely small, so I am hesitant to make firm conclusions, and we have plenty of evidence showing creatine supplementation to be efficacious with a variety of timing strategies. So, taking creatine at a convenient time seems to be entirely sufficient, but it might be prudent to take creatine post-workout if you’re super concerned about fully maximizing the benefit of creatine supplementation. As discussed in the section on types of creatine, I see the topic of creatine timing as a bit of a non-issue. In the quest for perfect creatine timing, we seek to boost creatine monohydrate from “very effective” to “maybe slightly more effective.” Creatine monohydrate, regardless of specific timing strategies, does a very suitable job of saturating muscle creatine storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;responders-and-non-responders%3A-a-spectrum&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responders and Non-Responders: A Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#responders-and-non-responders%3A-a-spectrum&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a kick out of kinesiology papers that arbitrarily describe “responders” and “non-responders” to an intervention. In the absence of a reasonably well-justified statistical process for categorization or a well-defined physiological basis for this grouping, it often ends up being a tool for researchers to say, “this totally worked, there was just something wrong with about half of our sample.” In the case of creatine, however, there is a well-defined physiological basis for non-response, and non-responders absolutely do exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For creatine to improve performance, it needs to meaningfully increase muscle creatine storage. Some people walk around with (just about) fully topped-off muscle creatine saturation, so they obtain no benefit from creatine supplementation. One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8203511/&quot;&gt;early studies&lt;/a&gt; on creatine supplementation measured both muscle creatine content and the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise. Five of their subjects had 25% greater creatine storage and 35% greater phosphocreatine resynthesis after supplementation, but three subjects (37.5% of the sample) did not have substantial increases in either outcome. About a decade later, another research team found that there were three “types” of responses in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15320650&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. Of the eleven total subjects, three (27% of the sample) had quite large increases in muscle creatine storage after supplementation, five (45%) had moderate (but substantial) increases, and three (27%) had very minimal increases. Furthermore, the responders improved their leg press after the five-day supplementation intervention, whereas the non-responders did not. Non-responders tended to be people who started the intervention with higher baseline levels of muscle creatine, fewer type 2 muscle fibers, smaller muscle cross-sectional area, and less fat-free mass than the responders. These characteristics provide some helpful information for determining your likelihood of being a non-responder and also help explain why multiple studies have shown creatine supplementation to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;larger effects in vegetarians&lt;/a&gt; than meat eaters. The prevalence of non-responders reported by these studies suggest that non-responders are certainly not rare, which may be one of several factors contributing to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12701815&quot;&gt;about 30%&lt;/a&gt; of the first few hundred creatine studies did not report significant ergogenic effects. Finally, it’s important to note that non-response to creatine is really a spectrum rather than a rigid category. Some respond extremely favorably, some have virtually no response, and most others fall somewhere in the middle. So when we use the term “non-responder” in the literature, we’re talking about people who display a level of response that most would consider negligible in magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hesitant to use these studies to estimate the exact percentage of people that are likely to be non-responders. These samples are very small and not truly sampled from the general population at random. When samples are this small, three out of eight can very easily turn into one out of eight or five out of eight, based purely on chance alone. In that scenario, 13% easily becomes 63%, and the global population of non-responders goes from about one billion to about five billion. However, we can fairly comfortably conclude that being a non-responder is by no means rare, but does not appear to be the norm. So, the current “best guess” is around 20-30%, and we can feel pretty confident that the number is probably above 10% and below 50%. In my experience, people who suspect they are non-responders often feel disappointed that they don’t get to join in on the fun and enjoy a performance boost from creatine supplementation. In reality, being a non-responder is great news. You were genetically pre-selected to win a lifetime supply of free creatine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creatine-and-bones&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine and Bones&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#creatine-and-bones&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bones don’t really get enough credit (or attention). Much like muscle, bone is a metabolically active tissue that exhibits pronounced adaptations in response to resistance training. In the last decade or so, some of the creatine research has started to drift away from muscle and toward bone. The reasoning for this line of inquiry is two-fold. First, resistance training increases muscle mass and strength. As a result, the amount of strain on bones during resistance exercise is increased, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7747001/&quot;&gt;bone strain stimulates bone accretion.&lt;/a&gt; Second, bones are metabolically active tissues that rely on ATP. Phosphocreatine’s role in ATP resynthesis should reinforce the ATP supply available for bone cells, which may promote bone formation and reduce bone resorption. As reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928444/&quot;&gt;Forbes et al&lt;/a&gt;, there are a few studies showing reduced levels of a protein associated with bone resorption following creatine supplementation with resistance training compared to resistance training alone. These findings suggest that bone resorption was reduced, which would likely promote increased bone content and density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5928444/&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; evaluated five studies on creatine supplementation with resistance training in older adults. Pooled analysis did not support the hypothesis that the addition of creatine would enhance bone mineral density, but the details suggest that hope is not entirely lost. There were a few key details that seemed to dictate which studies showed creatine to be beneficial. For example, only one study was a full year in duration, while the others were all six months or less. Bone is metabolically active and responsive to external stimuli, but it’s still pretty damn slow; it takes quite a while to see really substantial changes in bone remodeling, especially when you’re trying to find an effect of creatine that goes “above and beyond” the robust initial changes expected with the onset of resistance exercise. In line with this logic, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25386713/&quot;&gt;sole 12-month study&lt;/a&gt; reported a significant beneficial effect on bone density with creatine supplementation. Another key factor appears to be training frequency; while some studies in the meta-analysis had participants perform resistance training 1.5-2 days per week, two studies employed a training frequency of three workouts per week. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222402/&quot;&gt;Both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25386713/&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; with higher frequency observed beneficial effects on bone density or bone mineral content, despite that fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16222402/&quot;&gt;one of the studies&lt;/a&gt; was only three months in duration. In addition, these higher-frequency studies also gave creatine doses that were scaled to body weight (~0.1 gram/kilogram), while the remaining studies (which found no significant benefit) gave a flat 5 gram dose of creatine. As such, it is possible that the flat 5 gram dose of creatine was a bit underdosed for larger individuals in the studies reporting no significant benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results would suggest that creatine is most likely to benefit bone in the context of higher frequency resistance training (at least three days per week), when dosed at ~0.1 g/kg of body weight. In addition, the mechanism by which creatine affects bone turnover appears to be more anti-catabolic than anabolic in nature. As such, greater effects are likely to be observed in contexts in which bone turnover is accelerated or bone loss is more pronounced, such as prolonged weight loss, particularly rigorous training, or aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creatine-in-the-brain&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine in the Brain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#creatine-in-the-brain&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have long known that creatine plays a critically important role in the brain. While the brain’s pool of creatine only represents about 5% of the total creatine in the human body, the effects of brain creatine deficiency are devastating. There are congenital medical conditions that cause creatine deficiency in the brain, either due to impaired synthesis or impaired transport. When a child is born with such a condition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18652076&quot;&gt;severe effects&lt;/a&gt; on cognitive function and development are often observed. Even in the absence of inborn creatine synthesis or transport deficiencies, researchers have suggested that creatine may play an important role in the severity and progression of a wide variety of brain-related pathologies, including traumatic brain injuries, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Research has shown that creatine supplementation may increase brain creatine and phosphocreatine storage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086660&quot;&gt;by up to 10%&lt;/a&gt;; as such, the questions asked by creatine researchers have begun migrating from the muscle to the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The putative benefits of creatine supplementation relate to creatine’s ability to facilitate ATP resynthesis. The brain is one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11224660&quot;&gt;most metabolically active tissues&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a massive burden for energy production. It is always on, whether it is preventing you from sleeping as you consider all of your life’s most soul-crushing regrets, or it is simply reminding your body to breathe and initiate heart beats while you’re watching television. Creatine in the brain functions as an imperative energy source to ensure that neurons always have sufficient ATP to support their metabolic activity; a shortage of brain creatine presents an energy crisis, with damaging effects on the function and integrity of neurons lacking energy. Under normal conditions, cognitive tasks elevate brain activity, thereby increasing ATP demand. As explained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086660&quot;&gt;Dolan et al&lt;/a&gt;, the role of creatine in facilitating ATP resynthesis is elevated when these cognitive tasks become more complex or are challenged by acute stressors such as sleep deprivation, hypoxia, or fatigue. A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704637&quot;&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; summarized the effects of creatine supplementation on cognitive function in healthy people; results indicated that creatine improved performance on tests pertaining to short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning fairly consistently. While some positive findings have been reported for other cognitive outcomes, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, response inhibition, reaction time, and mental fatigue, these outcomes are improved less consistently. The review also found that creatine supplementation was more likely to improve cognitive function in older adults compared to younger adults and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118604&quot;&gt;vegans and vegetarians&lt;/a&gt; compared to meat-eaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progression and severity of several brain pathologies are directly tied to mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of ATP production. As such, there is great interest in how the ATP-buffering effects of creatine may relate to brain function, both in health and disease. The progression and severity of brain injuries and many neurodegenerative diseases are also linked to oxidative stress; as a result, it has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086660&quot;&gt;suggested &lt;/a&gt;that creatine may confer brain benefits via antioxidant effects in addition to other potential non-energetic mechanisms. When it comes to brain injuries, such as ischemia and mild traumatic brain injuries (concussions), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5469049/&quot;&gt;animal research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that creatine supplementation may reduce injury severity and improve recovery. While it’s difficult to do human research in which serious brain injuries are intentionally induced, these animal studies demonstrate that creatine’s effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative stress have potential to attenuate the damage resulting from brain injuries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24268530&quot;&gt;Human research&lt;/a&gt; has also shown benefits of creatine supplementation for humans with inborn creatine synthesis deficiencies, thus demonstrating that oral creatine supplementation can influence brain creatine levels to a clinically meaningful degree, at least in extreme cases. Several animal studies have suggested that creatine may have a promising therapeutic role for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and ALS. Human trials have failed to identify benefits of creatine for ALS; results from studies on Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease have been slightly more promising, particularly when treatment begins before the onset of clinical symptoms, but results have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748651&quot;&gt;underwhelming&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the creatine literature pertaining to brain function is fairly thin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086660&quot;&gt;Dolan et al&lt;/a&gt; provide a concise summary of what we know so far. Studies tend to show that creatine has minimal effects on cognitive function in relatively unstressed states, but its effects become more apparent in the context of stressors. Acute stressors include things like sleep deprivation, fatigue, hypoxia, and concussions; chronic stressors include things like inborn creatine deficiency, depression, and aging. Cognitive benefits of creatine appear to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704637&quot;&gt;more pronounced&lt;/a&gt; in older adults and vegetarians in comparison to young adults and meat-eaters. There is reason to have hope for creatine as a modestly beneficial adjunct therapy for managing progression and symptoms of certain neurological diseases, but more research is needed to verify the utility of this potential application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;creatine-side-effects&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine Side Effects&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#creatine-side-effects&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you Google &lt;em&gt;creatine side effects&lt;/em&gt;, a pretty wide range of results tend to pop up. Muscle cramping, kidney issues, liver issues, dehydration, weight gain, and gastrointestinal symptoms are listed most frequently. Luckily, several hundred creatine studies have been conducted over the last few decades, with some studies lasting up to five years in duration. So, we have a pretty good idea of what creatine does (and does not) cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, the liver and kidney concerns make sense. The liver and kidney are involved in creatine production and metabolite clearance, and small changes in select biomarkers associated with the function of each organ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10999421&quot;&gt;have been observed&lt;/a&gt;. However, more rigorous tests of organ function have, time and time again, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21399917&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to document any deleterious effect of creatine supplementation on healthy livers or kidneys in humans consuming creatine at ergogenic doses. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808512/&quot;&gt;one of our creatine studies&lt;/a&gt; documented an increase in serum creatinine levels. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, and is used as a marker of kidney function under normal circumstances. However, using creatinine to make inferences about kidney function absolutely and unequivocally relies on the assumption that you are not taking large doses of creatine. As a result, high creatinine values during creatine supplementation are to be expected, and they simply reflect that you have violated an enormous assumption of the serum creatinine test. Abnormal blood test results should never be &lt;em&gt;ignored&lt;/em&gt;, but more rigorous testing is required to effectively evaluate kidney function in this case. When it comes to kidney and liver function, thorough assessments have repeatedly shown no harm of creatine supplementation in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion about creatine side effects can be attributed to anecdotes and case reports in which creatine has been hastily blamed or implicated. A great example of this is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16509464&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; that was discussed in a review by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5371628/&quot;&gt;Rawson et al&lt;/a&gt;. The patient in the case study presented with rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure. The authors of the report felt so strongly about creatine’s role in promoting the case of rhabdomyolysis that creatine was specifically named in the title of the study. However, it’s worth considering that creatine has been studied hundreds of times, using thousands of participants, and I can’t recall reading about a single instance of rhabdomyolysis in any of these studies. Furthermore, the patient in the case study had recently received intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, undergone a surgery that included the use of a tourniquet, and skied into a tree, which are all tremendously plausible ways to get rhabdomyolysis. It is from anecdotes like these that we see creatine linked to outcomes like dehydration and muscle cramping. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;Several research studies&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed that creatine does not adversely affect outcomes relating to hydration, muscle cramping, or muscle injury. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14608430?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt; even shows creatine supplementation to reduce the incidence of heat illness/dehydration, muscle cramps, and injuries in competitive football players. The idea of creatine inducing dehydration is a particularly curious notion, as creatine robustly and reliably increases intracellular and total body water. As such, creatine has been shown on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z&quot;&gt;multiple occasions&lt;/a&gt; to actually enhance hydration status and thermoregulatory responses to exercise in the heat, thereby exerting a protective effect rather than a harmful effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine does not appear to induce kidney damage, liver damage, rhabdomyolysis, dehydration, muscle cramping, or muscle strains in otherwise healthy individuals. There are some select kidney and liver pathologies in which creatine supplementation may be contraindicated, so anyone with a pre-existing liver or kidney issue would be wise to consult with a physician before beginning creatine supplementation. Nonetheless, creatine appears to do no harm to otherwise healthy kidneys and livers, and it may even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26832170&quot;&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; the pathological accumulation of liver fat. Furthermore, it does not impair the body’s ability to make creatine after supplementation has stopped. That is not to say, however, that creatine is entirely without side effects. Some people consider weight gain via water retention to be a side effect, and this certainly occurs for most individuals. It’s also fairly common to observe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373286&quot;&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; with creatine supplementation; this effect is likely exacerbated if the creatine is poorly dissolved, consumed in large doses, or simultaneous ingested with a lot of caffeine. Finally, there are some fairly specific topics in which creatine’s effects are a bit complicated, and more detailed discussion is warranted. These topics include creatine’s role in immune responses and asthma, the effects of creatine on hair loss, and the potential for caffeine to interfere with the effects of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researchers study inflammation, a common method is to cause inflammation in the paw of a lab rodent and measure the ensuing inflammation-induced edema (swelling). This tends to cause responses from a whole host of inflammatory mediators including histamine, prostaglandins, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and a variety of interleukins, and toll-like receptors are heavily involved in the process. As reviewed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915971/&quot;&gt;Riesberg et al&lt;/a&gt;, early rodent studies found that both injected and orally consumed creatine attenuated inflammatory responses when multiple models of acute inflammation were tested. The results also seem to pan out for chronic inflammation; creatine has been shown to have favorable effects on the progression of arthritis using two different rodent models of arthritis. Most importantly, human trials have shown these effects to translate to exercise; studies have demonstrated that creatine reduces markers of inflammation following a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15306159/&quot;&gt;30km race&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17917696&quot;&gt;half-Ironman triathlon&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800565&quot;&gt;running-based anaerobic test&lt;/a&gt;. Creatine may also influence oxidative stress. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915971/&quot;&gt;Numerous studies&lt;/a&gt; using cell cultures have shown creatine to protect incubated cells from oxidative damage, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22009139&quot;&gt;study in rats&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that 28 days of creatine supplementation had an antioxidant effect on the response to acute exercise. Unfortunately, human research on this topic is fairly limited. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22080314?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found a significant reduction in the oxidative stress response to a single bout of resistance exercise in resistance-trained males following creatine supplementation, but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4625651/&quot;&gt;couple of studies&lt;/a&gt; have failed to find such benefits. Creatine also appears to modulate immune system activity; treating vascular endothelial cells with creatine (in vitro) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1573908/&quot;&gt;reduces adhesion&lt;/a&gt; of immune cells, which would theoretically be beneficial with regards to the development of atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one might expect, alterations in inflammation, immune function, and oxidative stress are not all unequivocally good things. For instance, a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4915971/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; has noted that these effects could collectively have an immunosuppressive effect. Few creatine studies are long enough to make meaningful inferences about illness rates, and illness rates are rarely reported in the few creatine studies that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; long enough. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12701814/&quot;&gt;three-year study &lt;/a&gt;in college football players found no increase in the prevalence of illness among creatine users, but previously documented immunosuppressive effects could potentially be more meaningful for people with compromised immune systems. Creatine has also been shown to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17641295&quot;&gt;exacerbate changes&lt;/a&gt; in airway remodeling and allergic/inflammatory responses in rodent models of asthma. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19569010&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also shown that aerobic exercise helps to attenuate these negative effects of creatine on asthma-related breathing complications. Furthermore, creatine’s effects for people with lung conditions are not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; negative; small, preliminary studies in humans have suggested that creatine has modest beneficial effects for training adaptations and well-being in patients with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15994258?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15463870?dopt=Abstract&quot;&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, although lung function was neither positively nor negatively affected in either study. In conclusion, creatine appears to influence immune function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The potential downsides of creatine with regard to asthma and the immune system are not fully understood yet; nonetheless, if I had asthma or a similar allergy-related inflammatory condition or had a clinically compromised immune system, I would personally err on the side of caution and shy away from creatine supplementation. Aside from those special cases, the effects of creatine on immune function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lung function appear to be either modestly beneficial or neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gain-strength%2C-lose-hair%3F&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gain Strength, Lose Hair?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#gain-strength%2C-lose-hair%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever heard that creatine is linked to hair loss, there is a research study that provides the basis for this purported link. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19741313&quot;&gt;2009 study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the effects of a one-week creatine loading period, plus two weeks of maintenance supplementation, on blood androgen levels in 18- to 19-year-old male rugby players. Several previous studies have evaluated the effects of creatine on testosterone levels, with the majority finding no significant effect. While this study also found no effect on testosterone, a significant increase in dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was observed. This is notable, because DHT is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573818&quot;&gt;known to play a very direct role&lt;/a&gt; in male hair loss. Testosterone is converted to DHT by an enzyme called 5ɑ-reductase; when DHT binds to receptors on hair follicles, hair loss is promoted via miniaturization of the hair follicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, subjects started the placebo protocol with a baseline DHT value of 1.26 nmol/L; DHT levels dropped to 1.09 by day 7, and to 1.06 by day 21. It was a crossover trial, so the exact same subjects also completed the creatine protocol. At the beginning of the creatine supplementation phase, baseline DHT was 0.98 nmol/L; it increased to 1.53 by day 7, and settled back to 1.38 by day 21. It’s important to note that values &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28472278&quot;&gt;up to around 3.0-3.5 nmol/L&lt;/a&gt; are considered “normal,” and DHT levels in the creatine study were fairly unstable. For instance, the baseline differences between the treatments, which should (theoretically) be just about equal, differed by nearly 0.3 nmol/L, and DHT should have been reasonably stable throughout the placebo protocol, but dropped by 0.2 nmol/L. As such, it’s difficult to get too worked up about the findings in the creatine condition, in which a curiously low baseline value (0.98 nmol/L) increased dramatically at the one-week time point before settling back to 1.38 nmol/L, which is only 0.12 nmol/L higher than the baseline value during the placebo protocol. It is also worth noting that both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471952&quot;&gt;acute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3040039/&quot;&gt;chronic&lt;/a&gt; exercise increase male DHT levels; in theory, a modest increase in DHT could potentially be attributed to a creatine-induced increase in training load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m aware of only one study measuring DHT changes in response to creatine supplementation. The study documented an increase, but DHT levels remained well within the normal range. Further, there are many steps that separate blood DHT levels from hair loss; in order to induce hair loss, the DHT must actually bind to the appropriate receptors on hair follicles and induce the miniaturization of hair follicles. It’s unclear whether or not this magnitude of effect on DHT would have a measurable effect on the rate of hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals. There is certainly no reason to believe that creatine would cause hair loss in individuals who are not genetically predisposed to hair loss. At this time, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that DHT accelerates hair loss in genetically predisposed individuals, but it is not an entirely far-fetched idea, and there is definitely enough evidence to warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;creatine-and-caffeine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine and Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#creatine-and-caffeine&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the mid-90s, when creatine research was just starting to gather some steam, a research group suspected that caffeine might improve creatine absorption if they were consumed together. Creatine enters muscle cells via specific, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2129152/&quot;&gt;sodium-dependent&lt;/a&gt; transporters. As such, the group suspected that caffeine would increase the activity of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps, which would theoretically increase creatine transporter activity (and muscle creatine uptake) by increasing the sodium gradient across the muscle membrane. The researchers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8929583&quot;&gt;surprised to find&lt;/a&gt; that the addition of caffeine had no effect on muscle creatine uptake; muscle creatine storage was effectively increased by creatine supplementation, with or without added caffeine. However, the researchers were even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; surprised to find that the addition of caffeine appeared to block the performance-enhancing benefit of creatine supplementation. Even though muscle creatine storage was significantly elevated, the creatine and caffeine treatment did not improve performance on the leg extension exercise test compared to the placebo treatment, while the creatine-only treatment did significantly improve performance. As one might expect, their discussion of the results offered very few concrete suggestions for &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this was observed, as it was the complete opposite of what they expected to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, the same research group did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11796658&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; after brainstorming some potential mechanisms by which caffeine could block the performance effects of creatine. In this follow-up study, they analyzed the effects of creatine and caffeine on muscle relaxation time. In theory, reduced relaxation time is a good thing. Crossbridge cycling (repeated attachment, detachment, and reattachment of actin-myosin crossbridges) is how force production happens, and crossbridges need to detach before they reattach again. Slowed (i.e., increased) muscle relaxation time is a well-known consequence of fatigue, and more rapid detachment could therefore be conducive to generating high forces in a short amount of time via an increased rate of crossbridge cycling and enhanced recovery time between contractions in rapid succession. In the follow-up study, this research group found that creatine alone reduces relaxation time, while chronic (multiple-day) use of caffeine alone actually increases relaxation time. When caffeine was chronically consumed during the creatine loading period, creatine’s effect on muscle relaxation time was blunted, and relaxation time was not significantly reduced. In this sense, the research group had followed up with a plausible mechanism to explain their previous finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this pair of studies would appear to tell a fairly concise story about caffeine blocking the ergogenic effect of creatine via prolonged muscle relaxation time, there might be more to the story. Roger Harris pretty much introduced creatine to the sport science research world, so his input on creatine carries as much weight as anybody’s. After the creatine and caffeine issue started getting some buzz, his group did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005768-200505001-01834&quot;&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; to see if they found similar effects, which they published in abstract form. Again, using a leg extension protocol, yet another study showed creatine to be effective, whereas the addition of caffeine throughout creatine loading blunted this ergogenic effect. Interestingly, this study reported that four out of ten participants who completed the study complained of gastrointestinal discomfort, which was notably more prevalent when caffeine was ingested with creatine compared to creatine alone. This is not the only study to observe gastrointestinal discomfort in response to the combination of creatine and caffeine; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254257368_Effect_of_Acute_Creatine_Supplementation_and_Subsequent_Caffeine_Ingestion_on_Ventilatory_Anaerobic_Threshold&quot;&gt;Quesada and Gillum&lt;/a&gt; reported similar discomfort in three out of seven subjects, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808512/&quot;&gt;our group&lt;/a&gt; noted the same observation in four out of thirteen subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love creatine, and they love caffeine. Suggesting that they might have to pick one or the other is like telling them to choose the favorite of their two children. As a result, there are a lot of people who simply refuse to entertain the possibility that caffeine could blunt the performance effects of creatine supplementation. There are a few arguments commonly used to suggest that the creatine and caffeine issue is quite simple and no interaction exists. The first argument pertains to the fact that many early creatine studies allowed, and even encouraged, participants to mix their creatine into hot coffee and/or tea. The recommendation made sense at the time, as creatine dissolves much more effectively in a hot beverage. However, this logic isn’t exactly air-tight. A cup of coffee or tea may yield up to 100mg of caffeine, give or take; this is a far cry from the 5 mg/kg dose used in many of the studies showing a creatine-caffeine interaction. In addition, it’d be wildly inaccurate to view coffee or tea as “caffeine water” and ignore the hundreds of bioactive compounds in each. It’s not implausible to think that one of these many compounds may alter the relationship between creatine and caffeine, or exert independent effects of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second argument suggests that the “interaction” observed in the creatine/caffeine studies is actually attributable to caffeine withdrawal. This argument contends that providing caffeine for a few days in a row promotes physiological dependence. To circumvent confounding results from the acute ergogenic effects of caffeine, many of the creatine/caffeine studies would disallow caffeine within several hours of exercise testing, which could theoretically hinder performance due to withdrawal symptoms. However, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005768-200505001-01834&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; published by Harris’ group casts doubt on this argument. They tested performance two hours following a caffeine dose, and again a day after caffeine supplementation ceased. The interference between caffeine and creatine was actually more apparent during the testing that occurred two hours after a caffeine dose, a time at which subjects would be far less vulnerable to performance-disrupting withdrawal symptoms than the testing occurring 24 hours after. The third argument is fairly simple: studies have shown multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements, containing both creatine and caffeine, to be effective ergogenic aids. This argument assumes that the creatine actually played a role in the ergogenic effect observed, on top of the benefits subjects may have been obtaining from the caffeine, beta-alanine, and 26 other ergogenic aids included in the formula. This argument also ignores the fact that most multi-ingredient pre-workout supplements also include way less creatine and caffeine than the doses in which the interaction has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more thorough look at the research question, check out the full-length &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26219105&quot;&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; I published a few years ago. More research is needed on this topic, but Figure 3 summarizes our current understanding. So far, the handful of studies on habitually consuming ergogenic doses of caffeine during creatine loading have either found caffeine to block the performance benefit of creatine, or they have reported no effect of creatine itself; none of them have shown creatine to work despite the addition of high-dose caffeine. The reason for this is up for debate. Some have proposed that caffeine’s diuretic effect opposes the water retention effect of creatine, but we know that their co-ingestion does not alter each others’ pharmacokinetic properties, we know that caffeine does not alter muscle creatine saturation, and I struggle to see how this would have a meaningful impact on performance. While there may be some merit to opposing effects on muscle relaxation time, the combination of high doses of creatine (typically upwards of 10 grams per day) and caffeine (typically up around 5 mg/kg per day) seem to commonly induce gastrointestinal discomfort in around 30-40% of (admittedly small) samples. The case is not closed, but I am increasingly convinced that the creatine/caffeine issue boils down to gastrointestinal discomfort; it’s hard to perform at your best under those circumstances. The &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; conservative approach would be to fully trust the small amount of data available, accept that caffeine blunts the ergogenic effects of creatine, and pick one or the other. A more moderate approach (and my current approach) would be to keep an eye on gastrointestinal symptoms and alter the dosing and timing of creatine and caffeine accordingly. Such an approach would probably favor restricting high-dose caffeine during loading (or favor the avoidance of loading), keeping caffeine near the lower end of the ergogenic range (3-5 mg/kg), and consuming your creatine and caffeine at different times throughout the day. A third approach would be to simply ignore the data available and assume that no interaction exists, mostly because it feels better and saves you from a difficult decision. Again, I think the more moderate approach provides a prudent strategy that avoids extreme knee-jerk reactions to a small (but growing) body of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty well-known that creatine supplementation increases muscle storage of free creatine and phosphocreatine, thereby increasing body weight, strength, and sprint performance. However, there’s a lot more to creatine than water retention and helping muscles create ATP during intense exercise, and there are a lot of questions that continue to be asked. Creatine affects a wide range of tissues, including the brain, the bones, and the lungs. Creatine influences inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune function. Questions pertaining to optimal forms of creatine, optimal dosing strategies, side effects, and interactions with other supplements linger. Our current understanding of creatine can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine improves high-intensity exercise performance, primarily by saturating muscle storage of free creatine and phosphocreatine, which enables rapid ATP recycling during exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No form of creatine has been shown to meaningfully and consistently outperform creatine monohydrate. However, creatine monohydrate degrades pretty rapidly in liquid, so it should be mixed pretty close to the time of ingestion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading and cycling of creatine are fine, but not necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine may confer modest benefits for bone and brain health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creatine is largely free of side effects in healthy people, aside from occasional stomach discomfort. This discomfort can probably be attenuated by completely dissolving the creatine dose in liquid, avoiding doses above 5 grams at a time, and avoiding co-ingesting high doses (≥3-5 mg/kg) of caffeine at the same time. For individuals with asthma, compromised immune systems, or certain pre-existing kidney or liver conditions, more caution may be required with regards to side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One study has shown creatine to increase DHT levels, but DHT remained within the normal reference range, and this does not necessarily equate to hair loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few studies have shown that high-dose caffeine blunts the performance benefits of creatine loading, but this might just relate to stomach discomfort caused by combining high doses of both ingredients. It’s possible that this can be avoided by implementing more strategic dosing approaches for both ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;addendum%3A-may-7%2C-2019&quot;&gt;Addendum: May 7, 2019 &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#addendum%3A-may-7%2C-2019&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this article was published, we received a ton of questions about gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort in response to creatine ingestion. So, I wanted to give a little bit of information about how to avoid GI discomfort associated with creatine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, there is some evidence suggesting that ingesting loading doses of creatine (i.e., 20+ grams per day) in conjunction with daily ergogenic doses of caffeine anhydrous (i.e., 3-5+ mg per kg of body weight) may upset your stomach. Aside from being generally unpleasant, this could also have a negative effect on performance. There are a few ways to minimize this risk. The most extreme approach would be to avoid consuming caffeine while on creatine. A less extreme approach is to simply keep the dosages in check. For example, this may involve using a maintenance dose of creatine instead of loading, or restricting caffeine dosages to “normal” day-to-day levels (&amp;lt;3 mg/kg per day) that are likely to give you some energy, but unlikely to substantially enhance performance. An even less extreme approach would be to simply separate the timing of your doses; caffeine would ideally be consumed 30-90 minutes before a workout, with creatine consumed at other parts of the day. For a maintenance protocol of creatine supplementation, this could very easily be done by restricting caffeine to early parts of the day and consuming creatine in a single dose later in the evening. I tend to suspect that the latter approach (temporally separating doses) is likely sufficient, but there’s a lack of research available to make any type of firm evidence-based conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, there are plenty of people who experience stomach discomfort when consuming creatine, even in the absence of caffeine. In this case, there are a few strategies that may be helpful. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373286&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that stomach discomfort is much more likely when consuming a 10-gram dose of creatine once daily, compared to two, 5-gram doses consumed twice daily. So, dividing your creatine dose into multiple, smaller doses may help. If that still doesn’t do the trick, it may be worth lowering the total daily dose. If your stomach doesn’t tolerate a loading protocol for creatine very well, simply ingesting a maintenance dose for 3-4 weeks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828669&quot;&gt;will get the same job done&lt;/a&gt;. Taking creatine on an empty stomach might also increase the likelihood of experiencing an upset stomach, so it’s probably a good idea to take creatine with food if you tend to notice stomach discomfort after supplementation. Finally, it’s likely that stomach issues will be exacerbated if the product is poorly dissolved when you ingest it. Creatine monohydrate is typically OK, but not great, in terms of its ability to fully dissolve. Adding your creatine to a hot beverage, such as coffee, tea, or hot water, greatly enhances its ability to dissolve rapidly. Again, you may prefer to use a decaffeinated beverage if you want to err on the side of caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some anecdotes floating around that alternate forms of creatine may minimize GI symptoms in comparison to creatine monohydrate. For some novel forms of creatine, such as creatine phosphate and magnesium creatine chelate, GI discomfort &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28019093&quot;&gt;has been noted&lt;/a&gt;. For some of the more popular alternate forms of creatine, including creatine ethyl ester and alkaline buffered creatine, I am unaware of research directly comparing their GI effects in comparison to creatine monohydrate. However, creatine ethyl ester and alkaline buffered creatine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033492/&quot;&gt;appear to be&lt;/a&gt; more susceptible to breakdown to creatinine in the gut, and research has shown them to either be less effective or equally effective when compared to creatine monohydrate. Furthermore, while creatine monohydrate has a large body of evidence supporting its safety and efficacy, the same cannot be said for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28019093&quot;&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; forms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080578/&quot;&gt;of creatine&lt;/a&gt;. The solubility of creatine hydrochloride and micronized creatine monohydrate might be a little better than normal creatine monohydrate, but you could also obtain this enhancement in solubility by simply mixing regular creatine monohydrate into a warm beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you notice stomach discomfort when you take creatine, you’re not alone. Simple strategies to minimize the likelihood of discomfort include taking creatine with food, mixing it into a hot beverage, taking less daily creatine or splitting it into multiple smaller individual doses, opting for a micronized creatine monohydrate product, and avoiding large doses (3-5+ mg per kg of body weight) of caffeine when consuming your creatine. While it’s possible that some of the alternate forms of creatine may have greater water solubility or induce less GI distress, these alternate forms tend to have less research supporting their safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has now undergone its fourth major revision on 3/26/2020. Most sections have been added to or rewritten. A few sections have been removed. Only the early sections on protein synthesis/anabolic signaling and early meta-analyses have remained the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tl%3Bdr-version&quot;&gt;TL;DR Version &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#tl%3Bdr-version&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average, muscle growth tends to be best around 6-8 hard sets per muscle group per training session when taking long rests. That can be 12 - 24 weekly sets for a frequency of 2-3 days per week. Volume needs may be double this when taking short rests, but the max muscle growth is still around the same so there&#39;s no advantage to doing short rests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual results may vary substantially from these averages, with some individuals having volume ceilings much higher than 8 sets per session or 20 weekly sets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume increases are best done in small (20%) increments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-takeaways&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-takeaways&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated meta-analytic data shows a logarithmic relationship between training volume and hypertrophy in a single session. Gains increase rapidly at small volumes and there is diminishing returns as you get to higher session volumes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On average, hypertrophy appears to increase with increasing volumes of up to 6-8 hard sets in a single training session when taking long rests between sets, with a plateau at higher volumes. This is approximately 12 - 24 weekly sets when training each muscle 2-3 days per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual results may vary substantially from these averages, with some individuals having volume ceilings much higher than 8 sets per session or 20 weekly sets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s an interaction between set volume and rest intervals. Since short rest intervals may impair hypertrophy for a given set volume, you have to do more hard sets to make up for it. Thus, volume requirements may be approximately twice that of long rest intervals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a volume/frequency interaction. There is some evidence of a maximum effective dose per training session, although it will vary from one individual to the next. To increase weekly volume, rather than continuing to increase volume above this ceiling per session, it&#39;s better to split weekly volume up into higher frequency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some evidence indicates that there are less non-responders with higher volumes, and that people tend to be more responsive when increasing their volume relative to what they were doing before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When increasing set volume, it is best to do it in small increments (20%).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that people tend to be more responsive when increasing volume relative to what they were doing before, there is a theoretical case for cycling set volume. This would involve slowly increasing volume over time to the highest effective per-session volume until a performance plateau is reached. Volume would then be decreased to a maintenance level for a period of time to re-sensitize the muscle to a volume stimulus. Volume would eventually be increased again, and this pattern would be repeated over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regardless of training volume, genetics play a strong role in hypertrophy. People who respond well to low volume will also tend to respond well to high volume, and people who don&#39;t respond well to low volume will likely still be a low responder to high volume (although the response will likely be improved).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardgainers may benefit from increasing their volume, compared to the popular strategy of reducing volume and frequency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When taking long rests (2+ minutes), per-session volumes of around 6-8 sets per muscle group will likely produce the best hypertrophy on average in trained subjects, although individual results and needs may vary dramatically from that average. Set volume may need to be double that when taking short rests (&amp;lt;=90 seconds).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The classic &amp;quot;bro-split&amp;quot; of blasting a muscle group for very high volumes (like 20 sets) once per week is likely an inferior way to train, and it is better to split the volume up into frequencies of 2-3 days per week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&#39;re training a muscle group twice per week with long rests, 12-16 weekly sets is likely a good range to give you the best &amp;quot;bang for your buck&amp;quot; when considering results versus time investment, although individual needs will vary. Some individuals may need volumes substantially higher than this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU MUST CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHEN PROGRAMMING VOLUME, including schedule, volume tolerance, recovery ability, available time to train, importance of achieving maximal hypertrophy, injury history, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum number of effective sets may be impacted by rest intervals, types of exercise used (compound versus isolation), and previous training volumes. Shorter rest intervals (90 seconds or less) with compound movements may require more sets to get the same response (and thus not necessarily save any time).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who have plateaued on low-to-moderate training volumes may benefit from an increase in training volume.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases in set volume should be small (around 20%).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This data doesn&#39;t suggest you train with high volumes all the time.  Periods of low volume training may be necessary to help with recovery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A volume cycling approach may be beneficial. In this approach, set volume is slowly increased over a period of time, until a maximum effective amount is achieved. This could be where successive 20% increases in set volume fails to stimulate further gains. Once this plateau is reached at this high volume, volume is reduced to a maintenance level (2-4 sets per muscle per session, 2-3 times per week) for a period of time to re-sensitize the muscle to a volume stimulus. Set volume is then ramped back up to the maximum effective dose, and the volume cycle is repeated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How many sets should I do?&amp;quot; is probably one of the most common questions that people have when trying to build muscle.  In fact, the number of sets you should do to build muscle can be such a point of contention that people have fought &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/a-h-i-t-less-at-bat-part-1-my-response-to-carpinellis-review-of-my-strength-meta-analysis/&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27805470&quot;&gt;journal article wars&lt;/a&gt; over it.  Entire training philosophies (i.e., &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/h-i-t-pocrisy-part-1/&quot;&gt;High Intensity Training and Heavy Duty&lt;/a&gt;) have been built around how many sets people think you should do.  In fact, for years, people have been arguing over whether you should train with a low number of sets, or high number of sets, to maximize muscle hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best approach, of course, is to examine the scientific evidence, and consider where the overall weight of the evidence lies.  In regards to training volume, it&#39;s not that easy, due to the limitations in the existing research.  Still, that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t come up with some solid evidence-based recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do We Mean by Set?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to clarify is what we mean by a &amp;quot;set.&amp;quot;  In a weight training workout, there are a lot of ways you can do a set, from a warm-up set that hardly pushes you to failure, to a gut-busting set of 20-rep squats to failure.  In this article, a set is going to be defined as a set of moderate to high repetitions (approximately 8 reps or more) to muscular failure or near failure.  I use this definition because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27928218&quot;&gt;high load, low rep sets do not produce as much hypertrophy as more moderate 8-12 rep sets&lt;/a&gt;, despite an equivalent number of hard sets.  However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853914&quot;&gt;moderate-rep and high-rep sets to failure are similar in their impacts on muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, a set should be to near muscular failure, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/research-review-to-fail-or-not-to-fail-part-2-the-impact-of-training-to-failure-on-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;stopping well short of failure will impair muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  Finally, a set counts towards a particular muscle group if that muscle group can be considered a prime mover in the exercise that is being used.  For example, 3 sets of bench press will count as 3 sets for triceps, since the triceps are active prime movers in a bench press.  Three sets of bench press, and 3 sets of tricep pushdowns, would count as 6 total sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Muscle Protein Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first places we can look for evidence is in the impact of set volume on muscle protein synthesis.  Remember that resistance training stimulates protein synthesis, the process by which your muscles build new protein.  When this process of protein synthesis exceeds the rate of protein breakdown, your muscles grow.  The elevation in protein synthesis happens very quickly after a training session, and continues for 24-48 hours after the session.  If set volume impacts muscle hypertrophy, then it would stand to reason that it may impact muscle protein synthesis as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581041&quot;&gt;One study that examined the impact of set volume on muscle protein synthesis came out of the lab of Stu Phillips&lt;/a&gt;.  The researchers compared 3 sets of leg extensions to 1 set of leg extensions.  Both groups trained at 70% 1-RM to muscular failure.  Fed-state muscle protein synthesis (the amount of protein your muscles make after you eat a meal, which is really important when it comes to building muscle size) was elevated by almost twice the amount in the 3-set group compared to the 1-set group.  Protein synthesis was still elevated by 130% at 29 hours after the training session in the 3-set group, but was back to normal in the 1 set group.  In other words, muscles were not only making more protein soon after the workout with 3 sets to failure, but they were still making more protein 29 hours later compared to 1 set.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27219125&quot;&gt;Since muscle protein synthesis correlates with gains in muscle size once you get past the initial muscle damage&lt;/a&gt;, this would imply that 3 sets is better than 1 set for putting on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/set-volume-muscle-protein-synthesis.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22859389&quot;&gt;In another study looking at the impact of set number on muscle protein synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, 6 sets of 8 reps at 75% 1-RM on the leg extension caused greater muscle protein synthesis up to 2 hours after the training session, as compared to 3 sets.  This was true in both young and old subjects.  Also, in the older (but not the younger) subjects, 6 sets of 14 reps at 40% 1-RM caused a greater muscle protein synthesis response compared to 3 sets.  There are two major problems with this study.  First, subjects did not train to failure...8 reps at 75% 1-RM, and 14 reps at 40% 1-RM, can be far short of failure for some individuals on a leg extension.  Second, the researchers only measured protein synthesis out to 4 hours.  Thus, this study might suggest that 6 sets per muscle group is better than 3 for muscle protein synthesis, but there are a lot of limitations to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268828&quot;&gt;In a third study by Damas and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, 12 sets to failure with 2 minute rests on the quadriceps (6 sets of leg press and 6 sets of leg extensions) only caused a small increase in muscle protein synthesis compared to 8 sets to failure (4 sets of each exercise) in trained subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/damas-muscle-protein-synthesis-set-volume.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Damas et al. (2019). VAR-sets did 12 sets in quadriceps, while CON did 8 sets. The increase in muscle protein synthesis from the additional 4 sets was very small, and was not related to hypertrophy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small increase in muscle protein synthesis was not associated with greater hypertrophy over 8 weeks, suggesting that the small increase may have been more due to a small increase in muscle damage. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This data suggests that muscle protein synthesis may begin to plateau somewhere in the 8-12 set range.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;one rodent study found that muscle protein synthesis increased with an increasing number of &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; of electrically stimulated muscle contractions, statistically plateauing at 5 sets but the raw mean peaked at 10 sets&lt;/a&gt;.  Protein synthesis tended to be lower at 20 sets.  However, a &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; in this study may not be equivalent to a a set as we define it.  There are also other differences &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;which I described in a research review&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of these differences, this data does align nicely with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268828&quot;&gt;the previous study by Damas et al.&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting a plateau in muscle protein synthesis somewhere around 10 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these studies, &lt;strong&gt;we can say that multiple sets will create more protein synthesis than single sets to failure, and it looks like the response may plateau between 8-12 sets in a session on average.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Anabolic Signaling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place we can look is the impact of set volume on anabolic signaling.  When you train with weights, the tension on your muscles sends molecular signals to muscle cells to start creating new protein.  One important molecular signal is called p70S6K phosphorylation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130904&quot;&gt;which has been found to correlate with gains in muscle size when measured 5 hours after a training session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some studies that have examined the impact of set volume on p70S6K phosphorylation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25861013&quot;&gt; One study showed 10 sets of 10 RM (leg press, 2 min rest) resulted in greater p70S6K phosphorylation compared to 5 sets of 10 RM when measured 30 minutes after the session&lt;/a&gt;.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20581041&quot;&gt;the protein synthesis study out of Stu Phillips&#39;s lab that was mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, p70S6K phosphorylation was significantly elevated at 29 hours after 3 sets of leg extensions, but not 1 set.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617335&quot;&gt;In a third study&lt;/a&gt;, 3 sets of 6 RM of a leg press resulted in a threefold elevation of p70S6k phosphorylation, and 5 sets of 6 RM resulted in a sixfold elevation (i.e., double the response). &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/3850-2/&quot;&gt;In the rodent study mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, p70S6K phosphorylation continued to increase with increasing &amp;quot;set&amp;quot; volume up to 20, although &amp;quot;sets&amp;quot; here cannot be considered equivalent to human sets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In a fifth study&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorylated S6K were 19% greater with 6 sets per muscle group performed in a training session versus 2 sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another molecular anabolic signal we can look at is the mechanistic target of rapcomycin or mTOR, a protein that regulates muscle protein synthesis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In this study&lt;/a&gt;, 6 sets per muscle group per session resulted in 12% higher phosphorylation of mTOR compared to 2 sets. In this same study, the higher volume resulted in a 28% greater phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s6, another signaling molecule involved in muscle protein synthesis. The higher volume also caused greater levels of RNA (a marker of creation of ribosomes, which are the site of protein synthesis) and transcription factor c-Myc, which is important in initiating RNA transcription (one of the steps in muscle protein synthesis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the anabolic signaling data tells us that &amp;quot;more is better&amp;quot; in terms of sets, but it doesn&#39;t give us an optimal range or tell us when &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; becomes &amp;quot;too much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Volume and Satellite Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle fibers have nuclei, which are the control centers for these muscle fibers and contain important genetic information.  To repair or build new muscle fibers, you need new nuclei.  Enter satellite cells, which are dormant cells located outside of muscle fibers.  When a muscle fiber is damaged, satellite cells donate their nuclei to allow the fibers to be repaired and grow.  Thus, satellite cells are an important component in the process of muscle hypertrophy.  Thus, if set volume impacts muscle size, then one mechanism through how it does so may be through satellite cell activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22417199&quot;&gt;Only one study has looked at the impact of set volume on satellite cell activation&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study, 3 sets of leg press and 3 sets of leg extension (6 sets for quadriceps total done 3 times per week, or 18 total weekly sets) resulted in greater satellite cell activation than 1 set of leg press and 1 set of leg extension (2 sets for quadriceps per session, or 6 weekly sets).  This was accompanied by a much greater increase in leg extension 1-RM strength as well (48% versus 29%).  This would suggest that a total weekly set volume in the teens might be better than single digits, at least for legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers also looked at satellite cell activation in the trapezius, as well as shoulder press strength.  They did not observe any impact of set volume on either satellite cell activity or shoulder press strength.  However, given that the trapezius is not a prime mover in the upper body exercises used in this study (seated chest press, seated rowing, lat pulldown biceps curl, and shoulder press), the satellite cell activity in the trapezius may not give us sufficient information as to the impact of set volume on satellite cells in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this data would suggest that a weekly set volume in the teens is likely better for hypertrophy than single digits, at least for the legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Biopsies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all of this data only tells us that, if you want to gain as much size as possible, multiple sets per muscle group are better than single sets, more sets are better than less (to a point), and weekly volume in the teens may be better than in the single digits.  But this is all based on extrapolation from data derived from muscle biopsies.  Ultimately, we need to look at what happens to changes in muscle size when you put people on training programs with different set volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fair number of studies have been done over the past few decades, that have looked at changes in muscle size when comparing different set volumes.  Results have varied, with some studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) showing more muscle gain with more sets, while other studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8897390&quot;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) showing no significant difference with more sets.  Differences in outcomes between studies might relate to differences in study design, in populations used, in training volume, in training frequency, etc.  However, another key factor that may explain the differences is one of sample size (i.e., the number of subjects in each study).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of why sample size may impact the results, let&#39;s say you want to do a study that compares low volume training to high volume training.  You need to know how many people you should recruit to your study.  So, you do what is called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;power analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This gives you an approximation of how many subjects you will need to successfully detect a particular difference between groups.  To do a power analysis, you need an idea of what sort of difference you are interested in seeing.  For example, perhaps you think that high volume training will give you double the muscle gains.  You then use data from previous research to get an idea of what the typical level of muscle gain in a study happens to be, and how much it tends to vary from one person to the next.  This data goes into the power analysis, and you end up with an estimate of how many people you are going to need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go through this power analysis exercise with some real world data.  Direct measurements of muscle size (like ultrasound) are superior to indirect measurements (body composition techniques like &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-6-dexa/&quot;&gt;DEXA&lt;/a&gt;), so we&#39;ll stick with data that uses those types of measurements.  Typical changes in muscle thickness, assessed by ultrasound, tend to be around 5-10% over a typical 8-12 week study.  So, let&#39;s say I think a low volume group might experience a 5% change in muscle thickness, and a high volume group might experience a 10% increase in muscle thickness.  Essentially, I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;ll get double the gains with high volume over low volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the number of subjects that I need?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26605807&quot;&gt;Using data from a rest interval study I collaborated on with Brad Schoenfeld, Menno Henselmans, and others&lt;/a&gt;, and then running the data through some online power analysis software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org/&quot;&gt;GLIMMPSE&lt;/a&gt;, it turns out &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would need approximately 100 subjects per group to declare a 5% versus 10% gain in muscle size as statistically significant, 80% of the time!!!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  If I reduce this to 50% of the time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would still need about 50 subjects per group!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if I did 100 studies, and wanted to be able to declare a doubling of muscle size as statistically significant in only 50 of those studies, I would need 50 subjects per group!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what is the typical sample size of most weight training studies?  Maybe 8-15 subjects per group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look at the statistical power if you only had 10 subjects per group.  Running the same data through GLIMMPSE, I get a statistical power of approximately 30%.  This means that, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with only 10 subjects per group, you will declare a 5 versus 10% gain in muscle size as statistically significant in only 30 out of 100 studies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;most weight training studies on volume are essentially set up to fail to detect important differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Changes in muscle size are small, and vary a lot from one person to the next, and so you need HUGE differences between groups to detect a difference over a typical 8-12 week study that only has around 10 people per group.  But the reality is that the impact of doubling your training volume isn&#39;t going to result in 3-4 times the gains.  It &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; result in a doubling of gains, but, as you just learned, most weight training studies have sample sizes that are simply too small to detect even that amount.  This is why you see disparate results among studies.  Some will successfully detect a difference based on random chance alone, while others will miss a difference, even if a true difference exists (in statistics, this is called a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;type 2 error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or false negative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of a possible type 2 error.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues looked at the effects of weight training set volume on muscle size&lt;/a&gt;.  They compared three volume levels:  low, medium, and high.  The following table shows the percentage gains in muscle size, as well as the effect size (a measurement of the meaningfulness of an effect), for each group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ostrowski-1024x321.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, double-digit weekly set volumes resulted in approximately double the muscle gains (the orange cells), but these differences were not statistically significant.  Why would this happen?  This study only had 9 subjects per group, so there&#39;s a good chance this is simply a false negative or type 2 error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Meta-Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing the limitations in the existing data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300012&quot;&gt;in 2010 I decided to do a meta-analysis on the impacts of set volume on muscle hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  A meta-analysis is a &amp;quot;study of studies.&amp;quot;  This is where you group a body of studies together, and statistically analyze them to see if there&#39;s an overall trend.  In other words, it&#39;s a formal way of seeing where the weight of the evidence lies.  A meta-analysis can be useful when you have a lot of studies with small sample sizes.  The idea is, perhaps each study alone is too small to be able to detect a significant difference between groups, but if you group all the studies together, most of the studies should favor one group over another in terms of the raw average, if there&#39;s truly a difference.  Basically, if a lot of studies have results like the one by &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski that I mentioned above&lt;/a&gt;, then that&#39;s a pretty good indication that higher volumes truly are better...it&#39;s just that the studies are too small in size to consistently show it (i.e., a type 2 error as I mentioned earlier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did this analysis, I found that multiple sets per exercise were superior for hypertrophy compared to single sets.  Both categories of 2-3 sets per exercise and 4-6 sets per exercise were greater than 1 set.  The magnitude of the average effect size (again, effect size is a value assessing the meaningfulness of an effect) tended to favor 4-6 sets over 2-3 sets, although that difference was not statistically significant.  Here&#39;s a chart from the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hypertrophy-es.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there were a number of limitations to this analysis.  First, there were only 8 studies that met my inclusion criteria.  There were only 2 studies that involved 4-6 sets per exercise.  There wasn&#39;t enough data to determine if there were differences due to factors such as training status (i.e., trained versus untrained subjects).  I was the sole author on this paper, so there was no one available to double check my work, and thus it&#39;s always possible some bias or error could sneak in.  This analysis only tells us about volume in a single session, and not overall weekly volume.  Finally, sets per exercise is not the same thing as sets per muscle group.  For example, you could do 1 set of incline press, 1 set of flat press, and 1 set of decline press, and that&#39;s 3 sets for your chest, but in this analysis it would be categorized as 1 set.  Still, more sets per exercise will still mean more sets per muscle group, so this meta-analysis clearly showed that your gains increase as your volume increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Even Better Meta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, more studies on hypertrophy had come out.  Brad Schoenfeld, Dan Ogborn, and I discussed doing an updated meta-analysis, with all of the new research included.  In this analysis, we would have multiple individuals coding the studies to serve as a double-check on accuracy, and help reduce bias.  We would also look at volume in terms of sets per muscle group per week, rather than sets per exercise.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433992&quot;&gt;Our results were published in the June 2017 issue of the Journal of Sports Science&lt;/a&gt;, and we confirmed a relationship between training volume and hypertrophy.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;ll note that since that paper was published, we did discover an error in how volume was classified for a study by Correa and colleagues; we erroneously classified weekly volume as 9 sets in the high volume group and 3 in the low volume group, but it in fact was 18 in the high volume group and 6 in the low volume group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  While this did not materially impact the conclusions of the paper, it did impact the dose-response relationship so that it wasn&#39;t apparent as you moved from &amp;lt;5 sets to 5-9 sets (but it still existed for higher volumes).  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m reporting the fixed numbers to you this review, so they are slightly different from the published paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we found a highly significant effect (with a P value of 0.003...remember that 0.05 is considered significant) for each additional weekly set.  For each additional weekly set that was done, the effect size would increase by 0.027, and the percentage gain in muscle size would increase by 0.38 percentage points.  So, if you did 16 weekly sets (such as 8 sets per muscle group, twice per week) compared to 6 weekly sets (like 3 sets per muscle group, twice per week), the effect size would be higher by 0.27, and the percentage gain would be higher by 3.8 percentage points (such as an 8.8% improvement in muscle size versus a 5% improvement).  Now, this analysis assumes a linear relationship between set volume and hypertrophy, which in real life would likely not be the case.  In other words, this doesn&#39;t mean you can just keep doing more and more sets and assume the gains keep going higher; at some point they will level off and possibly even regress due to overtraining.  Unfortunately we didn&#39;t have enough studies utilizing really high volumes to get an idea where the upper limit for volume might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When categorizing the weekly set volumes into &amp;lt;5, 5-9, and 10+ weekly sets, there was a distinct advantage to double digit weekly set volumes, with nearly double the gains (ES = Effect Size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Impact-of-Weekly-Set-Volume-on-Muscle-Size-1-1024x682.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also divided weekly volume into less than 9 sets, or 9+ sets.  Again, the higher volume was better.&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/impact-of-weekly-set-volume-on-muscle-size-9-sets-1024x682.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a forest plot of all the studies included in the analysis.  A forest plot tells you whether high volume or low volume was favored in each study.  If a dot is to the right of the center line, it means that study tended to favor high volume.  If it&#39;s to the left, it tended to favor low volume.  The further to the right or left, the stronger the effect.  The size of each dot represents the weight of the study in the analysis; studies with larger sample sizes get more weight.  You can see that nearly all of the studies are to the right of the center line, indicating most studies favored high volume.  Some are dramatically to the right of the line.  In fact, only one study is to the left of the line.  This is consistent with an impact of training volume on hypertrophy.  If there was no impact of volume, then studies would be more randomly distributed around the center line, with some studies to the left, some to the right, and some on the center.  However, this is clearly not the case.  The average across all the studies is represented by the large black diamond at the bottom, which you can see favors higher volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/volume-forest-plot-1-1024x576.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving Deeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that meta-analysis was published, there is much more existing data on the impacts of set volume on hypertrophy. Let&#39;s do some updated meta-analyses and deeper dives into recent studies and see what we find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems With Previous Meta-Analytic Approaches, and the Inverted U Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my previous meta-analysis that I published with Brad Schoenfeld, I had classified volumes within each study as &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lower.&amp;quot;  Given there are now a fair number of studies using 3+ different levels of volume in the same study, it&#39;s no longer appropriate to classify volume in such a way.  It&#39;s also not appropriate because, if there is a maximum volume ceiling per training session, then dividing volume this way could mask this effect.  In other words, if I were to use this classification, some studies might show higher volume to be better than lower volume, but others might show higher volume to produce a regression in performance.  When aggregated together, it would suggest there is no benefit to variations in volume.  However, if the latter study used a very high per-session volume that would exceed the theoretical per-session threshold, while the former study did not, it would be misleading to aggregate them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&#39;s say study #1 compares 9 weekly sets to 18 weekly sets, divided into three times per week.  That&#39;s 3 versus 6 sets per session.  Let&#39;s say study #1 shows a benefit to the higher volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study #2 comes along and compares 9 weekly sets to 18 weekly sets, but only trains once per week.  That&#39;s 9 versus 18 sets per session.  Study #2 shows a benefit to the lower volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to aggregate study #1 and study #2 together, they would appear to cancel each other out.  Both compare 9 to 18 weekly sets, but show the opposite results.  However, the two studies utilized different frequencies; it&#39;s very possible that study #1 showed a benefit because the per-session volume was fairly low, and study #2 showed the opposite because the per-session volume became excessive in the highest volume condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the previous approach I had used for meta-analysis (comparing higher versus lower volumes in each study in a binary fashion, or performing a meta-regression while ignoring frequency) is not a good approach.  A better approach is to examine whether there is an interaction between volume and frequency.  If there is, then it would indicate it is better to look at training volume on a per-session basis, rather than a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem with my previous approaches is that my statistical models tested for a linear relationship between volume and hypertrophy.  However, this doesn&#39;t effectively test the inverted U hypothesis of training.  The inverted U hypothesis suggests that hypertrophy would decrease if training volumes became excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inverted-u.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to test the inverted U hypothesis with a simple linear function, it would suggest a flat line and no relationship between volume and hypertrophy.  However, this is simply due to the use of the wrong model.  A more appropriate model would be a quadratic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/inverted-u-linear-versus-quadratic-1024x760.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also possible that there isn&#39;t really a regression at higher volumes, but more of a plateau or perhaps just slight regression. In this case, an inverted U or quadratic function isn&#39;t appropriate. For example, perhaps our model needs to reflect that there&#39;s a rapid increase in gains as you increase volume in the low end, with diminishing returns in the higher&lt;br&gt;
end. For example, rodent muscle protein synthesis data shows a rapid initial increase followed by diminishing returns and a slight&lt;br&gt;
regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ogasawara.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, a logarithmic relationship is probably the best, or perhaps a logarithmic relationship for early set volume and a flat or slightly declining linear relationship for very high volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Technical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what I did.  Now, this section is a bit technical, so you can skip it if you don&#39;t care about methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effect size for each outcome was created by calculating the post-test mean minus the pre-test mean, divided by the pooled pre-test standard deviation.  For example, if there were three levels of volume, then the pre-test standard deviation was pooled across all three levels.  I analyzed the data using what is called &lt;em&gt;robust variance random effects modeling for multilevel data structures&lt;/em&gt;.  This probably sounds like a bunch of statistical gobledygook to you, so I&#39;ll explain it in laymen&#39;s terms.  Basically, when you have a study, you can often have multiple outcomes from the same study (like quadriceps and biceps data).  You have to account for the fact that those outcomes will be correlated, since they&#39;re from the same study (you can&#39;t treat them as independent).  This is where the &amp;quot;multilevel data structures&amp;quot; comes in; my stats help account for this.  Also, a &amp;quot;random effects&amp;quot; model, in laymen&#39;s terms, essentially means that I can&#39;t account for every possible source of variance between different studies, and that the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; effect of volume may vary somewhat randomly (rather than be a single value), so I need to incorporate that uncertainty into my stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, each study is not weighted the same.  Obviously, a study with a larger sample size (and hence more precision) should get more weight in the analysis.  So, each outcome was weighted by the inverse of its variance (i.e., less variance = more precision = more weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike my previous iterations of the analysis, I primarily ran set volume as a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable#Continuous_variable&quot;&gt;continuous variable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I took per-session volume and fit linear, quadratic, and logarithmic functions to the data to determine the best fits. Also, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;rest intervals may impact the relationship between volume and hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;, I ran separate analyses for studies using long rests (2+ minutes) and short rests (&amp;lt;2 minutes).  I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-regression&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;meta-regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Regression Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With short rest intervals, hypertrophy increased with increasing volume up to 15-16 sets per session, albeit with diminishing returns. This was true for both trained and untrained subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/volume-chart-short-rest-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long rest intervals, a breakpoint model fit the data best, with a combination of a logarithmic curve and a straight line. This model showed hypertrophy to increase up to 6 sets per muscle group, followed by a very gradual regression after that. None of the studies with untrained subjects exceeded 6 sets per muscle group per session, and there were very few data points with less than 6 sets in trained subjects. Thus, I haven&#39;t separated it out by trained and untrained subjects, although an analysis of specifically trained and untrained subjects yielded curves with coefficients (the &amp;quot;multiplier&amp;quot; in an equation or model) similar to the combined data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/volume-chart-long-rest.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data would suggest that, with long rest intervals, gains level off or maybe even regress beyond &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an average&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of 6-8 sets per muscle group per training session. I stress average here because &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;there&#39;s data showing that individuals may deviate substantially from this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the concept of an upper limit of effective volume of around 8 sets in a single training session when using long rest intervals is supported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/set-volume-for-muscle-size-the-ultimate-evidence-based-bible/#proteinsynthesis&quot;&gt;the muscle protein synthesis data described earlier in this article, where muscle protein synthesis appeared to plateau somewhere in the 8-12 set range&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see how rest intervals impact the upper limits of training volume. With short rest intervals, you have to do approximately twice as many sets per session as with long rest intervals to maximize gains. For a more detailed analysis on this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;check out this Weightology research review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarizing the Meta-Regression Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this data suggests &lt;strong&gt;a threshold of somewhere around 6-8 sets per muscle group per training session when using long rest intervals. You may have to do approximately double this amount when using short rests&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There appears to be an upper limit on of training volume per session, where higher volumes beyond a certain level become &amp;quot;junk volume&amp;quot; and no longer become effective.  &lt;strong&gt;This indicates that the &amp;quot;bro-style&amp;quot; of training each muscle group once per week, blasting each muscle with up to 20 sets per body part or more, may be an inferior way to train&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you&#39;re training above 8 sets per muscle group per session, you may get some benefit of splitting your volume up into more frequent sessions. However, this may vary between individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might think that this contradicts information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;the Frequency Bible&lt;/a&gt;, where there was little difference between training frequencies on a volume-equated basis.  However, the vast majority of studies did not exceed 10 sets per session.  Only two studies involved a frequency where the per-session volume greatly exceeded 10 sets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/High_Resistance_Training_Frequency_Enhances_Muscle.95259.aspx&quot;&gt; Zaroni and colleagues compared 15 sets per session, done once or twice per week, to 3-6 sets per session, done five times per week&lt;/a&gt;.  Hypertrophy was superior in the higher frequency condition.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29528962&quot;&gt;Brigatto and colleagues compared 16 sets per session, done once per week, to 8 sets per session done twice per week&lt;/a&gt;.  Hypertrophy was similar between the conditions.  However, improvements in training load volume were superior in the higher frequency group.  This would suggest that, if the study had been carried out over a longer period of time, that greater hypertrophy may also have followed in the higher frequency condition.  Thus, training frequency likely doesn&#39;t make a difference when the per-session volume is less than around 10 sets.  However, if it greatly exceeds 10 sets, then it may be more beneficial to split the volume into a higher frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also important to note that, in the previous graph, there is a lot of variance.  Within any given set volume, there is a huge range in effect sizes.  For example, with a per-session volume of 6 sets per muscle group, effect sizes range from around 0 to around 1.5.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This demonstrates why one should be wary of drawing too much conclusions from one study when it comes to set volume and hypertrophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; different studies with the same set volumes per session can have widely different results.  This also shows why meta-analysis and meta-regression are so important; it allows you to assess the overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can&#39;t stress enough that these are very rough averages. Just because the average across studies suggests a 6-8 set per muscle group ceiling with long rests, doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s true for all individuals. Some individuals may have volume ceilings much higher than this. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;this study that I reviewed in my research review&lt;/a&gt;, some subjects had volume ceilings up into the 30+ weekly set range. They trained twice per week, so some subjects had volume ceilings roughly double the 6-8 set ceiling, even when training with longer rests. However, the averages in that study didn&#39;t show much benefit beyond 20+ weekly sets. &lt;strong&gt;This is why averages can be misleading&lt;/strong&gt;. Averages can be a starting point when it comes to program design, but don&#39;t treat them as a holy grail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume and Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original version of this guide, I used some strength data by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21451937&quot;&gt;Marshall et al&lt;/a&gt;., &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski et al&lt;/a&gt;., and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083231&quot;&gt;Baker et al&lt;/a&gt;. to make some inferences about the dose-response effect of volume on hypertrophy.  I assumed a strong relationship between strength and size gains in trained individuals, and used the strength gains in those studies as a proxy for hypertrophy.  However, as I&#39;ve written in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/progression-for-hypertrophy-your-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;Progression Guide&lt;/a&gt;, the relationship between strength and size is not as close as once thought, even in trained subjects.  In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;in a recent study that I was a co-author on&lt;/a&gt;, there were no differences in 1-RM bench or squat gains between three levels of volume (1, 3, and 5 sets per exercise) in trained subjects.  This is despite the fact that there was a graded dose response in hypertrophy.  There was also no correlation between strength gains and size gains in that study.  The following charts show the strength gains and muscle thickness gains; you can see no difference in 1-RM or endurance gains, but a graded dose response in three out of the four muscle groups tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impact of Volume on 1-RM and Endurance Gains (1, 3, or 5 sets per exercise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dose-response-1024x667.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dose-Response Impact of Volume on Hypertrophy (Sets Per Exercise)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;strength data cannot be used to make inferences about the impacts of volume on hypertrophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Is Too Much?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original version of this guide, I had suggested that an optimal volume lie in the 12-18 weekly set range, and that weekly set volumes of 20+ likely would not result in further gains.  This was based on the following observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the study by &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; on trained subjects, the triceps were subjected to either 7, 14, or 28 weekly sets.  Gains nearly doubled moving from 7 to 14 weekly sets, but there was no further increase with 28 weekly sets.  Also, bench press performance dropped off with that level of volume.  This suggested that perhaps weekly volumes in the high 20&#39;s may be more than necessary.  However, one limitation of this study, which I did not address in the original version of the guide, is that the researchers did not assess bicep gains.  They also did not do anything beyond 12 weekly sets for quadriceps.  Thus, this study is insufficient for determining where an upper limit may lie, as only one muscle group was trained for more than 20 weekly sets.  It&#39;s also important to note that the training frequency for triceps in this study was two times per week.  Thus, the 28 weekly set condition involved 14 sets per session, exceeding the approximate 10-set per session threshold that we established earlier.  Thus, the observed plateau in this study may be due to the frequency.&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ostrowski-triceps.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ostrowski-triceps-1024x237.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original guide, I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/research-review-german-volume-training-for-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;the German Volume study that I reviewed in a past research review&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study on trained subjects, 24 weekly sets was not more effective than 14 weekly sets for quadriceps, and 28 weekly sets was not more effective than 18 weekly sets for biceps and triceps.  However, it should be noted that many of these sets were not to failure.  German Volume Training involves doing 10 sets of 10 with 1 minute rest, and you use the same weight for all sets.  The subjects started with 60% 1-RM on most exercises.  In many cases, people can do around 20 reps with 60% 1-RM (this will vary from one person to the next).  This means that early sets were well short of failure; in fact, many of the early sets will fail to accumulate very many &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/quantifying-hypertrophic-reps-and-hypertrophic-volume-load/&quot;&gt;hypertrophic reps&lt;/a&gt;.  Remember that, in this guide, we&#39;re defining volume as the number of &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; sets to failure or near failure.  In this study, the subjects were not doing 14-28 hard sets.  In fact, it&#39;s difficult to ascertain how many hard sets the subjects did.  Also, it likely varied from one person to the next since it was based on % 1-RM, rather than doing sets to a specific Reps In Reserve (RIR).  In other words, one person might be able to do a lot more reps than another person with 60% 1-RM, so their initial sets will be much easier.  Thus, this study is not a reliable data point for determining where an upper limit may lie.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29910312&quot;&gt;The same holds true for another 2018 German Volume Study&lt;/a&gt;; the methodology was nearly identical, and it again is not reliable for determining an upper limit for volume.  It should also be noted that the training frequency was twice per week for upper body, and once per week for lower body in this study.  Thus, the highest volume condition was doing 24 sets per session for lower body, greatly exceeding the theoretical 10-set limit.  This group was doing 14 sets per session for upper body, again exceeding the theoretical 10-set limit.  Thus, the training frequency and per-session volume may also be contributors to the lack of volume effect observed in this study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24083231&quot;&gt;a study by Baker and colleagues that examined strength, not hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;.  In this study, 36-45 weekly sets did not improve strength over 12-15 weekly sets in trained subjects.  However, gains in strength may not be a good proxy for hypertrophy, even in trained subjects.  This might be particularly true in a study like this, where the cumulative fatigue from the very high training volume (36-45 weekly sets) might mask any hypertrophy-related strength gains.  Thus, this study may not be a reliable data point for determining an upper limit for set volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a study performed was performed on high volume training by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2018.00084/full&quot;&gt;Haun and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.  Training lasted for 6 weeks.  Subjects started 10 sets per exercise per week (split into three sessions per week), with approximately one compound exercise per muscle group (squat, bench press or overhead press, SLDL and lat pull).  Subjects did 10 reps per set at approximately 60% 1-RM; the average Reps In Reserve (RIR) was around 4.  Set volume was progressed each week, so that subjects were doing 32 sets by week 6.  Lean mass (assessed via &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-6-dexa/&quot;&gt;DEXA&lt;/a&gt;) significantly increased by 2.2 kg by the end of the study.  The researchers used bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) to estimate the amount of intracellular vs. extracellular fluid, and subtracted the extracellular fluid amount from the DEXA lean mass to estimate how much tissue gain was &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; tissue gain, versus extracellular water (which might be considered edema or swelling from the high training volume).  The researchers found that, while lean mass continued to increase with progressively higher volume, there was no longer a significant increase in lean mass from the midpoint of the study to the end when the results were corrected for extracellular water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Huan-volume.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study has been used as evidence to indicate anything beyond 20 weekly sets isn&#39;t effective for hypertrophy.  However, there are a number of problems with this conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes in ultrasound-derived muscle thickness (a direct measurement of hypertrophy) were less than 1 mm and were not statistically significant, suggesting that there was very little hypertrophy that occurred in terms of muscle thickness in the muscle groups assessed via ultrasound (vastus lateralis and biceps).  Average muscle fiber area also did not significantly change.  This brings up whether the DEXA data reflects &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; hypertrophy in any way.  Now, this doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t any true hypertrophy in this study.  The increases in DEXA derived lean mass were fairly large.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562558/&quot;&gt;You can sometimes get increases in muscle size, assessed via cross-sectional area, without a corresponding increase in muscle thickness&lt;/a&gt;, as measurements of muscle thickness are done at a very specific point in the muscle.  It&#39;s possible that this happened in this study.  The increase in lean mass via DEXA was not statistically significant, although it did heavily favor an increase (the confidence interval ranged from -0.97 to 5.35).  The BIS data showed an increase in total body water.  This suggests the increase in DEXA lean mass was associated with an increase in body water, which is not always reflective of actual muscle tissue gain (although keep in mind that muscle itself contains mostly water, so this doesn&#39;t rule out muscle growth as a factor).  Overall body mass tended to go in the same direction as the DEXA lean mass data, although not statistically significant.  There are a number of possibilities for this study.  There could have been an increase in muscle size that wasn&#39;t adequately captured by the muscle biopsy or thickness data.  Another possibility is that the subjects may have been slightly overfeeding.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22215165&quot;&gt;Overfeeding alone can increase lean mass in the absence of training, although it also usually accompanied by fat gain&lt;/a&gt;.  It is possible that, if the subjects were slightly overfeeding, it was enough to impact lean mass without significantly impacting body fat, especially given that the subjects were training.  However, such an increase in lean mass would not be &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; muscle, and rather simply an increase in body water.  A third possibility is fluid accumulation that is not related to increases in muscle tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weights were 60% 1-RM, which can be as far as 10 reps away from failure depending upon the individual.  The average RIR for all sets was around 4; in some cases it came near 5.  Remember that this is the average, meaning that some sets were performed with a much higher RIR while others were performed with less.  It should also be noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933716&quot;&gt;the accuracy of RIR tends to fall off the further away you get from failure&lt;/a&gt;.  Thus, subjects were training fairly well short of failure for a number of sets, and thus some sets don&#39;t fall into the &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; sets category.  There may have also been errors in their estimates for RIR.  This makes it difficult to know the number of &amp;quot;hard sets&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of BIS to estimate changes in ECW and ICW in healthy individuals, specifically as a marker of edema in muscle, has not been validated.  In fact, there is no data to indicate that subtracting the BIS-derived ECW from the lean mass in DEXA is valid for distinguishing muscle edema from other types of lean mass changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final note is that upper limits on training volume will also depend upon the individual. While there may be, &lt;strong&gt;on average&lt;/strong&gt;, an upper limit of around 6-8 sets per session or 12-24 weekly sets when using long rests, individuals may differ substantially from the average. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;In this study that I reviewed in my Research Review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;some individuals had benefits of 15+ sets per session or 30+ weekly sets, even with long rests&lt;/strong&gt;. This was despite the average not showing much benefit beyond 20+ weekly sets. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;averages are only a very rough guide for programming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Volume Training: Dose-Response Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take a closer look at the dose-response studies that involved very high weekly set volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;by Raedelli and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers compared 1 set, 3 sets, and 5 sets per exercise, done three times per week.  Sets were performed for 8-12 reps to failure, with 1.5 - 2 minutes rest.  The subjects performed bench press, leg press, lat pull down, leg extension, shoulder press, leg curl, biceps curl, crunch, and triceps extension.  If you count the pushing movements towards tricep volume, and the pulling movements towards bicep volume, the total weekly volume for each muscle group was 9, 27, and 45 for triceps, and 6, 18, and 30 for biceps.  The study was carried out over a 6 month period, and was performed on untrained subjects.  It was one of the most well-controlled studies on volume, given that it was performed on Brazilian Navy cadets confined to an aircraft carrier.  Also, it was carried out for 6 months, compared to the usual 6-12 weeks of other studies.  Here are the percentage gains for each muscle group and each volume level:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/radaelli-volume-1024x576.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a clear dose-response effect in terms of volume in this study, especially in the biceps.  In fact, the gains in muscle thickness observed with 30-45 weekly sets were 3-4 times what is typically seen in studies (most studies show around a 5% increase in muscle thickness).  Now, one odd result of this study was that there was hardly any increase in tricep muscle thickness for a volume of 27 weekly sets.  This is at complete odds with other studies that show significant gains in tricep thickness with much lower volumes in untrained subjects.  The sudden jump to nearly a 21% gain at the highest volume is also very strange.  However, this does not invalidate the study; &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;as I&#39;ve written elsewhere, you can get odd results like this from random chance alone&lt;/a&gt;.  Overall, the study did support an effect of volume, and no plateau was observed for weekly set volumes of more than 20.  It should also be noted that the researchers examined fat-free mass gains.  There were no significant differences between groups in fat-free mass gains; however, this data is likely not reliable since it was assessed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-pitfalls-of-body-fat-measurement-part-5-skinfolds/&quot;&gt;skinfolds, which are not a reliable technique for assessing changes in fat-free mass.&lt;/a&gt;  Also, the control group showed a significant increase in fat-free mass; this indicates potential error in the measurements as you would not expect the control group to show an increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;In a study of which I was a coauthor&lt;/a&gt;, Brad Schoenfeld and colleagues replicated the design of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;Radaelli study&lt;/a&gt;, but with trained subjects.  The subjects performed 1, 3, or 5 sets per exercise, for 8-12 reps to failure and 1.5 minute rests.  They trained 3 times per week for 8 weeks.  One difference from Radaelli, other than the length of the study, was that nearly all movements were compound movements (bench press, military press, lat pull, seated row, squat, and leg press; the only isolation movement was leg extension).  Total weekly sets were 6, 18, and 30 for biceps and triceps, and 9, 27, and 45 for quadriceps.  A significant dose-response effect was observed in the biceps, rectus femoris (part of the quadriceps), and vastus lateralis (part of the quadriceps).  There was not a significant effect for triceps, although the overall pattern had similarities to the other muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dose-response-1024x667.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big strength of this study was that it was mostly a replication of another study, and the results were similar.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication&quot;&gt;Replication is an important concept in science&lt;/a&gt;; when independent research groups can replicate results, it gives more credence to the findings.  This study, along with Radaelli, provide evidence that the upper limit for weekly volumes may be higher than previously thought.  You can also see the dramatic variation in how people respond to any given volume.  For example, in the low volume groups, some people had higher gains in muscle thickness than some of the people in the highest volume groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we classify subjects into &amp;quot;low responders&amp;quot; based on whether they met the &amp;quot;smallest worthwhile change&amp;quot; (which is at least 0.2 standard deviation units, or a &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; effect size), then the percentage of low responders decreases as you increase volume.  In fact, there were very few low responders in the highest volume condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/low-responders-1024x682.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same holds true for high responders (define as improving by at least 0.8 standard deviation units, or a &amp;quot;large&amp;quot; effect size).  As volume increased, the percentage of high responders also increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/high-responders-1024x682.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data would suggest that, for people who are &amp;quot;hardgainers&amp;quot;, an increase in volume may be necessary.  This is at odds with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hardgainer.com/&quot;&gt;the conventional wisdom that hardgainers require less volume and more recovery&lt;/a&gt;.  However, this data is in agreement with &lt;a href=&quot;https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP273480&quot;&gt;research on endurance training&lt;/a&gt;, where non-responders do show a response when subjected to more volume.  Now, there are some limitations to this type of analysis.  The percentage of responders could be a totally random phenomenon; if you were to replicate this study, you might end up with no apparent responder/non-responder effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160627&quot;&gt;Heaselgrave and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; explored the impact of 9, 18, or 27 weekly sets on biceps thickness, isometric strength, and 1-RM strength.  Trained males were allocated to a low volume, moderate volume, or high volume group.  The low volume group performed 9 sets targeting the biceps once per week.  The moderate and high volume groups performed 9 or 13-14 sets per session, twice per week.  Exercises were seated supine biceps curl, supine grip bent over row, and supine grip pulldown.  The low and moderate volume groups did 3 sets of each exercise.  The high volume group did 4-5 sets of each exercise.  Subjects performed each set for 10-12 reps, aiming for 2 Reps In Reserve (RIR).  Rest periods were 3 minutes between sets.  There were no significant differences between groups in changes in 1-RM strength or biceps thickness, although isometric strength only improved in the highest volume group.  While there were no significant differences in changes in bicep thickness, the magnitude of the percentage gain tended to favor the moderate group over the other groups (9.5% versus 4.3% or 5.4%).  Judging by the individual data, it appears there were more high responders in the moderate group, as well as less non-responders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/heaselgrave-chart.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study was that subjects were allowed to train outside of the study.  While the researchers asked the subjects not to do any sort of pulling or bicep movements, and while the subjects did record their own training journals outside the study to ensure this wasn&#39;t happening, it can&#39;t be ruled out that they may have been doing some other pulling or bicep work.  Another limitation is the short duration of the study (6 weeks); it is the shortest study among all the dose-response studies on volume.  It is possible that longer durations could show differences; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414336&quot;&gt;one study found no significant difference in hypertrophy between 12 and 4 weekly sets after 6 weeks, but did  show a difference after 20 weeks&lt;/a&gt;.  A third limitation is that the groups used different frequencies; the low volume group trained biceps once per week, while the other two groups trained biceps twice per week.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;While frequency does not appear to impact hypertrophy much on a volume equated basis&lt;/a&gt;, it may impact hypertrophy when weekly training volumes become high as I pointed out earlier in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/1997/08000/The_Effect_of_Weight_Training_Volume_on_Hormonal.3.aspx&quot;&gt;Ostrowski and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; examined the effects of 1, 2, or 4 sets per exercise on hypertrophy in trained subjects.  The study lasted for 10 weeks.  Subjects did 7-12 reps to failure per set, with 3 minute rests between sets.  Each exercise was performed once per week.  Triceps were trained twice per week, as pressing movements were performed on one day, and isolation movements were performed on another day.  Only triceps and quadriceps hypertrophy were assessed.  Quadriceps training volume did not exceed 12 total weekly sets since they were only trained once per week.  However, triceps weekly volume, when counting pressing movements, was 7, 14, and 28 for the low, moderate, and high volume groups, respectively.  There were no significant differences in changes in triceps thickness between the groups, although the percentage gains and effect sizes favored the groups doing 14 and 28 weekly sets.  In fact, percentage gains and effect sizes for 14-28 weekly sets were about twice that of 7 weekly sets.  There was little difference between 14 and 28, however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I no longer consider the Barbalho studies (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328502454_Evidence_for_an_Upper_Threshold_for_Resistance_Training_Volume_in_Trained_Women&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/doi/10.1123/ijspp.2018-0914&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) as reliable studies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/15/2/article-p268.xml&quot;&gt;One of the studies has been retracted&lt;/a&gt;. I will have more info on the other one in the future. They are not included in this review or in any of the meta-regression analyses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/publishahead/Progressive_Resistance_Training_Volume__Effects_on.94521.aspx&quot;&gt;Aube and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; looked at the impacts of 12, 18, or 24 weekly sets on hypertrophy in quadriceps of trained subjects. They didn&#39;t find a dose-response relationship. There was no significant differences in hypertrophy between the weekly volumes. For a detailed analysis of this study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/more-volume-or-not-so-many-studies-so-much-confusion/&quot;&gt;check out my research review article on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31868813-high-resistance-training-volume-enhances-muscle-thickness-in-resistance-trained-men/?from_term=muscle+hypertrophy&amp;amp;from_sort=date&amp;amp;from_size=10&amp;amp;from_page=2&amp;amp;from_pos=1&quot;&gt;Brigatto and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; looked at the impacts of 16, 24, or 32 weekly sets on hypertrophy in trained subjects. They did see a dose-response relationship, with increasing hypertrophy up to the highest volumes. For a detailed analysis of this study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-january-2020/more-volume-more-muscle-it-may-depend-on-the-training-structure/&quot;&gt;check out my research review article on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are there differences in the outcomes of these dose-response studies?  Three show a benefit to very high weekly volumes (two of which had very similar study designs), while three do not.  There are a number of potential explanations for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random chance&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/why-do-resistance-training-studies-differ-in-their-findings-a-lesson-in-sampling-variance/&quot;&gt;As I have written about here&lt;/a&gt;, you can get different results in training volume studies due to random chance alone, even if study designs are identical (which in this case, they are not).  This is especially true when you have small sample sizes (most resistance training studies don&#39;t have more than 9-20 per group), and you&#39;re measuring something that shows tremendous variance from one person to the next, like hypertrophy.  In that article, I did a statistical simulation of 5 different studies that sampled from populations that showed a graded dose-response effect of volume on hypertrophy.  The studies all had different outcomes, as you can see in this set of charts:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sampling-Variance-five-simulated-studies-1024x479.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it&#39;s possible that one factor behind the different results of these studies are due to random chance, or a combination of random chance and different study designs.  This is why meta-analysis and meta-regression become important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short vs. Long Rest Intervals&lt;/strong&gt;.  The three studies showing a graded dose-response relationship up to very high volumes involved short rest intervals of around 90 seconds or less.  The studies that showed a plateau at lower volumes had rest intervals of 2+ minutes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26605807-longer-interset-rest-periods-enhance-muscle-strength-and-hypertrophy-in-resistance-trained-men/?from_term=Schoenfeld%5Bau%5D+long+rest&amp;amp;from_sort=date&amp;amp;from_pos=3&quot;&gt;Longer rest intervals usually result in more hypertrophy than short rest intervals for the same number of sets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/training-for-hypertrophy-reconciling-the-impacts-of-short-rests-with-drop-sets-and-rest-pause-training/&quot;&gt;This appears to primarily occur with compound movements, and central fatigue may be a mechanism&lt;/a&gt; (although there is debate about this). The use of short rest intervals on compound movements &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/training-for-hypertrophy-reconciling-the-impacts-of-short-rests-with-drop-sets-and-rest-pause-training/&quot;&gt;may inhibit recruitment of high threshold motor units (which have the most capacity for hypertrophy) due to central fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. When you train with short rest intervals, you have to do more sets to make up for this. For a more detailed analysis of this, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-january-2020/more-volume-more-muscle-it-may-depend-on-the-training-structure/&quot;&gt;this research review&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/set-volume-dose-response-curves-and-rest-intervals-beyond-the-volume-bible/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previous Training Programs&lt;/strong&gt;. The training program a subject is on prior to participating in a study may impact the subject&#39;s response to the study. A subject who has already been training with high volumes may not have the same response as an subject who had been training previously with low volumes. Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;the size of the volume jump may impact gains&lt;/a&gt;. Differences among studies may relate to the types of programs subjects were on before embarking on the training, and which groups they were randomized to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that the differences between studies could be due to a combination of some or all of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding Your Individual Volume Ceiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guideline of 6-8 hard sets per muscle group per session is based on averages across multiple studies. As I mentioned before, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;individual volume ceilings may be substantially higher for some people&lt;/a&gt;. So how do you find your own volume ceiling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method is to use small increments in volume and use progress as a guide when to stop. Start with a low volume of training. When progress stops, increase weekly volume by 20%. For example, if you&#39;re doing 8 weekly sets (4 sets twice per week), increase it to 10 (5 sets twice per week). This should stimulate further progress. Once you hit a plateau, increase weekly volume again by 20%. If an increase in weekly volume of 20% fails to stimulate further progress, try one more 20% jump. If those two successive 20% jumps fail to stimulate further progress, then you&#39;ve likely hit a volume ceiling for that muscle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you&#39;ve hit a volume ceiling and aren&#39;t progressing anymore? Volume cycling might be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Theoretical Case for Volume Cycling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the Schoenfeld volume paper showed an increasing number of responders with increasing volume. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-february-2020/more-volume-or-not-so-many-studies-so-much-confusion/&quot;&gt;the Aube study showed that the responders were primarily individuals who increased their training volume relative to what they were doing before&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17395765/&quot;&gt;A third study by Bamman et al&lt;/a&gt;. showed that only 16% of the young subjects were non-responders at a volume of 27 weekly sets on quads. All together, this data would suggest that increasing set volume is an effective means to stimulate hypertrophy, especially if someone has reached a plateau and is not responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a limit to how much you can increase volume to achieve further gains. As suggested by the inverted U hypothesis, at some point gains will plateau or regress if volume becomes too high. Thus, at high training volumes, increasing volume is no longer an option once a plateau has been reached. In this situation, dramatically decreasing volume is likely the best option. This would theoretically have the following effects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would allow cumulative fatigue to dissipate, resulting in the expression of new strength gains that may have been masked during the cumulative fatigue of the high volume period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would allow for the maintenance of the new size gains, while simultaneously re-sensitizing the muscle to a future volume stimulus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of set volume needed to maintain size is much smaller than the amount of volume needed to increase size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weight-training-research-reviews/how-low-can-you-go-the-impact-of-reduced-training-frequency-on-strength-size/&quot;&gt;In a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;, cutting volume from 24 weekly sets (3 times per week) to 8 weekly sets (2 times per week) for 8 weeks resulted in a maintenance of size gains in untrained men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131862&quot;&gt;In this study by Bickel et al.&lt;/a&gt;, untrained subjects did 27 weekly sets to near failure on legs (3 exercises for 3 sets each, 3 times per week).  Training went on for 16 weeks.  This was followed by two different reduced training periods that lasted for 32 weeks.  One group reduced volume by 1/3 (to 9 weekly sets), where training was reduced to only once per week.  The other group reduced volume to 1/9 (3 weekly sets), where frequency was reduced to only once per week and set volume was reduced to one per exercise.  The 1/9 volume condition maintained size in the young but not old subjects.  Muscle size continued to increase in the young, but not old, subjects of the 1/3 volume group for 16 weeks, and then remained steady for another 16 weeks.  Both conditions resulted in a maintenance of strength, if not slight improvement during the reduced volume phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11909878&quot;&gt;In a study on elderly men&lt;/a&gt;, subjects performed 9 weekly sets on legs (3 sets of leg extensions, 3 times per week) for 12 weeks.  This was followed by a 12 week reduced training period where frequency was reduced to once per week (1/3 total weekly volume).  Size and strength were maintained on the reduced volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/the-rapid-research-rundown/rapid-research-rundown-2-16-2017-low-carb-vs-high-carb-detraining-protein-supplementation-and-metabolism-weight-loss/&quot;&gt;In a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;, lean mass was retained during 2 weeks of no training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of re-sensitizing a muscle to training is supported in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/weightology-weekly-classics/weightology-weekly-classics-muscle-gain/periodic-training-breaks-muscle-size/&quot;&gt;a study I reviewed here at Weightology&lt;/a&gt;. In that study, subjects who took 3-week breaks from training experienced decreases in muscle size during those 3-week periods. However, when they returned to training, they gained muscle at a faster rate than subjects who had been training continuously until they caught up with those subjects. This indicates that the muscles of the subjects who took time off were sensitized to the training stimulus due to detraining, and experienced rapid regain (also often called &amp;quot;muscle memory&amp;quot;). But what would have happened if, rather than completely taking time off, the subjects simply had done a period of reduced training volume? We don&#39;t know, but we can speculate that perhaps the subjects might have maintained their size, and then when returning to full volume, might have increased at a faster rate than the subjects training at constant volume. However, this is purely speculative, and unfortunately there is no research that has examined this directly. There is at least some theoretical basis for it, though. Once the body adapts to a stimulus, you must provide more stimulus (volume in this case) to continue to produce adaptation. However, you cannot continue to increase the stimulus indefinitely. At some point, you need to make your body more responsive to the stimulus again, and the only way to do that is to reduce (but not eliminate) the stimulus. This will allow for maintenance of adaptations, while allowing the body to recover and become primed for a future increase in the stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also possible that gains may continue for a period of time during a reduction in training volume. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131862&quot;&gt;the study by Bickel and colleagues that I mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, subjects continued to gain size when they cut volume from 27 weekly sets to 9 weekly sets (but not 3 weekly sets). Now, this study was on untrained subjects, but it at least raises the possibility of continued gains during the initial periods of volume reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this limited data, we can hypothesize that volume cycling may be beneficial to maximizing hypertrophy over time. Set volume is increased over time until a maximum effective stimulus is achieved. You stay at this volume until performance plateaus, and then dramatically reduce volume for a period of time. You then start the cycle again. This approach is similar to the approach of cycling between minimum effective volume and maximum recoverable volume recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://renaissanceperiodization.com/&quot;&gt;Mike Israetel and Renaissance Periodization&lt;/a&gt;. One primary difference from their method is that you use performance as a gauge as to when to stop a high volume cycle, rather than having a preplanned number of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how a hypothetical cycle might progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with a low training volume (for example, 2-3 sets per muscle group or 4-6 weekly sets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add sets per muscle group or per exercise over time (such as once per week, or per session as long as you don&#39;t experience next-day soreness). &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/research-review-march-2020/training-volume-individualization-is-key/&quot;&gt;Some research suggests a 20% increase in set volume is appropriate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue adding sets until you hit a plateau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If two successive 20% increases in volume fail to stimulate further progress, then you&#39;ve likely hit a plateau. Reduce volume back to near the volume is step 1. You may continue to notice strength improvements during this time as cumulative fatigue dissipates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue training at low volume for a period of time to allow your muscles to re-sensitize themselves to a new volume stimulus. The amount of time will likely depend upon how you feel and how your gym performance is doing. If gym performance starts to regress during the low volume period, increase volume a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step #2 and ramp volume back up again. Continue cycling between periods of low, medium, and high volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative process would be to only increase volume when you hit a plateau as described in the previous section &amp;quot;Finding Your Volume Ceiling.&amp;quot; For example, you stick with low volume until performance is no longer improving. Once you hit a plateau, you increase volume by 20%. You continue to increase volume by 20% for every plateau until two successive volume increases fail to further stimulate progress. Then you go back to low volume and start the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process can be used in the context of body part specialization (&lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/set-volume-for-muscle-size-the-ultimate-evidence-based-bible/#highexample&quot;&gt;discussed later in this article&lt;/a&gt;). Perform a volume ramp with one or two muscle groups, while keeping all other muscle groups on low volume maintenance. Once the high volume cycle is finished for those one or two muscle groups, return those muscle groups to low volume, and then begin a volume ramp for one or two other muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that this is all speculative and hypothetical. We need more research examining the impacts of varying set volume over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume Cycling Via Alterations in Frequency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing weekly volume by adding training days represents an alternative to adding sets within a training session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, increasing volume by adding frequency would increase gains. Unfortunately, there is very limited research as to the effects of using a higher frequency as a tool to increase volume. One study where this did occur was the study by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160627&quot;&gt;Heaselgrave and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; which was discussed earlier. The lowest volume group did 9 sets on biceps, once per week, while the moderate volume group did 9 sets on biceps, twice per week. While not statistically significant, the increase in frequency tended to show an improvement in hypertrophy, with a doubling of the percentage change (9.5 versus 4.3%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/heaselgrave-chart.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this was the only study performed on trained subjects. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29852092&quot;&gt;Barcelos and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; compared 3 sets of leg extensions performed 2, 3, or 5 times per week (6, 9, and 15 weekly sets) in untrained subjects. While changes in muscle size tended to be the greatest in the highest weekly volume group after 4 weeks, the other groups caught up so that by the end of 8 weeks, changes in muscle size were similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/different-frequencies-and-volumes-in-beginners-1024x682.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, individual results may vary from the averages..&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289872&quot;&gt;This same study by Barcelos&lt;/a&gt; showed about a third of beginners benefited from an increase in frequency, another third benefited from a decrease in frequency, and a third showed no additional benefit to either one. Thus, with 2/3 of the subjects showing either a benefit or neutral effect of lower frequency, beginners are best erring on the side of low volume and frequency for their hypertrophy programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For experienced individuals, a method of volume cycling using frequency could start off with 5 sets once per week, and then progress to 5 sets twice per week after 6-12 weeks or a plateau is experienced. After another 6-12 weeks or a plateau, frequency is increased again to three times per week (15 weekly sets). A final overreaching phase could then be undertaken with 5 sets performed 4 times per week (20 weekly sets). Then frequency can be reduced back to 1-2 times per week to begin another volume cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Genetics of the Volume Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While volume may be a tool to help turn non-responders into responders, especially in trained subjects, there are still limitations to its ability to induce a response. The evidence suggests that how people respond to volume is genetically determined. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666347v1&quot;&gt;In this study&lt;/a&gt;, beginning lifters performed single leg press and single leg extensions. One leg was trained with low volume (1 set per exercise or 2 total sets for quadriceps), and the other with moderate volume (3 sets per exercise or 6 total sets for quadriceps). Since this was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;within-subject design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, it removes the effect of genetic variability, and allows a scientist to isolate the effect of volume. The response to low volume was correlated to the response with high volume, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 (1 is a perfect correlation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/volume-correlation.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, subjects who were good responders to low volume also tended to be good responders to high volume. Subjects who were poor responders to low volume also tended to be poor responders to high volume (even if the response was improved). This suggests that genetics are the ultimate dictator of how much muscle you&#39;ll gain, regardless of your training volume. Some people will grow a lot no matter what type of training they do, and some people won&#39;t grow much no matter what type of training they do. While increasing volume may help with your response, it is unlikely that increasing volume will turn you from a hardgainer into an easy gainer. Rather, it is more likely you&#39;ll just turn into less of a hardgainer. That&#39;s not to say you won&#39;t get improvement from increasing volume if you are a hardgainer. If you look at the above graph, there were certain individuals who had a much better response with more sets (such as one individual who went from a 2% change in muscle size with 2 sets per session to nearly a 10% change in muscle size with 6 sets per session).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this same study, the researchers found that the subjects who responded the best to higher volume had a greater accumulation of total RNA in their muscles. This was indicative of greater creation of ribosomes, which serve as the site for protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counting Sets: The Direct Vs. Indirect Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice that, in all of this, a set of direct isolation work (like a biceps curl) is treated as a set count of 1, and indirect work (like a row) is also treated as a set count of 1.  The question is whether counting direct and indirect movements as 1:1 in terms of sets is valid.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s no research to guide us to the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; ratio (assuming there is one).  In one study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1653&amp;amp;context=ijes&quot;&gt;it was shown that subjects tended to recover faster from single joint lifts compared to multijoint lifts&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that isolation movements may be less stressful than compound movements and possibly benefit from more volume and frequency.  However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25807025&quot;&gt;other data suggests that recovery from single joint exercise may be slower than multijoint exercise&lt;/a&gt;, which would tend to support the idea that a set of compound movements shouldn&#39;t be counted as &amp;quot;1 set&amp;quot; for muscles like triceps.  Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38034743_Neuromuscular_Activity_During_Bench_Press_Exercise_Performed_With_and_Without_the_Preexhaustion_Method&quot;&gt;muscle activity in supporting muscle groups (like triceps in a bench press) may not be maximal compared to a single joint movement&lt;/a&gt;, which would tend to question the 1:1 counting method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is not clear whether counting direct and indirect volume as 1:1 is the best method.  Nevertheless, there is very little data to suggest any other method, and anything else (like counting each compound movement as a &amp;quot;half set&amp;quot;) is based purely on speculation.  Thus, until the data clearly shows otherwise, it is likely best to use the 1:1 counting method. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336594&quot;&gt;This is the same recommendation put forth in a review paper on this topic by Brad Schoenfeld, Cody Haun, Eric Helms, and others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Practical Limitations of Very High Volumes: A Personal Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if very high volume training may be useful in certain situations, and even if one can tolerate such training, one must consider the practical limitations of trying to train with such volumes, especially in regards to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194&quot;&gt;the high volume training study performed by Schoenfeld, me, and others&lt;/a&gt;, the average training time per session for the highest volume group was 68 minutes.  The subjects performed 7 exercises, for 5 sets each, for a total of 35 sets per session.  However, it&#39;s important to note that this time frame of 68 minutes may not be realistic when applied to someone training in a regular gym. In a resistance training study, you have research assistants pushing you along, and also helping to get weights set up for you.  There&#39;s also no waiting for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with a real-life gym situation, where you don&#39;t have anyone hurrying you along from one exercise to the next, and no one is setting up your weights for you.  I decided to try an experiment to see how long my training sessions would be, if I tried to do 5 sets per exercise so that I was achieving around 30 weekly sets for most muscle groups.  I started out at 1 set per exercise, and would slowly add sets over a number  of weeks to allow my body to adapt to ever increasing volume, and to help minimize any soreness.  When I got to 5 sets per exercise, I was doing the following in a whole body workout (all sets had 90 seconds rest between them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets hack squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets incline dumbbell press (30 degree incline, neutral grip)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets leg extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets machine flye&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets skullcrushers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets machine row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 sets dumbbell curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session (35 work sets total), including warmups, took me about 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete.  Thus, this is a fairly long workout, longer than what I like to do personally (I don&#39;t like to exceed 90 minutes).  At three times per week, this would be about 6 hours per week of training.  Keep in mind that doesn&#39;t even achieve a full 30 sets per muscle group for all muscle groups.  Back only amounts to 15 weekly sets.  There is no calf work, hamstring work, or direct shoulder work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one difference between my experiment and the Schoenfeld study is that I utilized a number of isolation exercises.  Nevertheless, there is a fairly large difference between my experience and the study.  My own experience is probably more relevant to what would happen in real life, as people generally don&#39;t have others pushing them along or setting up weights for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up the idea that, for most people, achieving very high volumes for most muscle groups is going to be unrealistic, especially if you&#39;re using free weights where it takes time to set up.  Thus, the most realistic way to achieve high volumes is through the use of specialization, focusing on 1-2 muscle groups while training everything else in the low to moderate volume range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tying It All Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science, there is something called a &amp;quot;convergence of evidence&amp;quot;, also known as &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience&quot;&gt;consilience&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;  This is where, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be strong even if the conclusion from any one particular piece of evidence is not strong.  In this case, we have lines of evidence from protein synthesis data, anabolic signaling data, satellite cell data, and meta-analytic data, all clustering around a conclusion that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;more volume is better for hypertrophy, up to around 6-8 sets per training session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is only if you&#39;re using long rests between sets (2+ minutes). If you&#39;re using shorter rests, then volume needs may be higher. These are average ranges and individual needs may vary substantially from these ranges. Here&#39;s an overview of how all the evidence converges.  You can see how every line of evidence points to a similar conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/set-volume-hypertrophy-conclusions.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a number of limitations to these conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may sound like a broken record here, but this is based on average responses.  &lt;strong&gt;Individual responses to differences in volume can vary from the overall average dramatically, and thus volume needs will vary from one person to the next.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be some benefits to cycling volume (similar to the Renaissance Periodization method) and having volume &amp;quot;re-sensitization&amp;quot; periods, but this is speculative and the data is limited at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These results only apply to set volumes involving moderate to high repetition ranges (approximately 8 reps or more) to failure or near failure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary based on factors such as age, training status, etc.  Age may be a particularly relevant factor here, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://weightology.net/the-members-area/evidence-based-guides/training-frequency-for-hypertrophy-the-evidence-based-bible/&quot;&gt;recovery time may increase with age&lt;/a&gt;.  It should be noted that the studies involving 21+ weekly sets all involved young subjects in their 20&#39;s.  Older individuals may not be able to tolerate such volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary between different muscle groups (such as upper versus lower body), if they need to vary at all.  Currently most of the data suggests there is no benefit, but more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is insufficient data to tell us how volume needs might vary between different types of exercises (like compound versus isolation, or exercises that load a muscle under stretch versus ones that don&#39;t).  It&#39;s possible that some exercises may need less volume; for example, exercises that load a muscle under stretch (like an overhead dumbbell triceps extension) are more damaging to muscle tissue than exercises that don&#39;t (like a hip thrust), so it might be easier to &amp;quot;overdo&amp;quot; it in terms of volume with the loaded stretch exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly set volumes of 21+ are very high, and are going to be more than many individuals can tolerate or have time for.&lt;/strong&gt;  Remember that significant gains are achieved with low to moderate volumes**.  You must consider the needs of an individual, including schedule, volume tolerance, recovery ability, available time to train, importance of achieving maximal hypertrophy, injury history, etc.**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cannot be ruled out that individuals training with low to moderate volumes may eventually achieve the same gains as higher volumes, but over a much longer time frame.  However, there is no research examining this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending upon an individual&#39;s available time to train, it may be difficult for someone to achieve 21+ weekly sets for most major muscle groups, even if he/she can tolerate the volume.  In situations like these, it may be best to focus on a couple individual muscle groups, training them with very high volume, and using a maintenance volume on the other muscle groups.  Then, after a period of 2-4 months, switch to emphasizing some different muscle groups.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bryankrahn.com/youre-too-boring-to-build-muscle/&quot;&gt;This is a strategy that has been recommended by Bryan Krahn&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most training studies only last 8-12 weeks.  It&#39;s possible that, if you&#39;re training with 21+ weekly sets for a muscle group, you may not tolerate such volumes for longer periods of time (although the study &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25546444&quot;&gt;by Raedelli and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; lasted for 6 months and involved weekly volumes of 30-45 sets for the arms).  This is where the needs of the individual have to be considered, including many factors mentioned before (training history, injury history, how close sets are being performed to failure, types of exercises being used, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions in science are always tentative.&lt;/strong&gt;  The conclusions of this review may change as more data is accumulated (this review has already undergone four major revisions as new data has come in!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting to note, anecdotally, that some top trainers in the industry use specialization routines and weekly set volumes of 30-40 to achieve maximum hypertrophy in target muscle groups.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bretcontreras.com/&quot;&gt;Bret Contreras&lt;/a&gt; often programs 30-40 weekly sets for glutes in his clients, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bryankrahn.com/youre-too-boring-to-build-muscle/&quot;&gt;Bryan Krahn has mentioned using specialization and 30-40 weekly sets to maximize hypertrophy in a particular muscle group&lt;/a&gt;.  My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jpshealthandfitness.com.au/sharing-gains-program-design-arm-hypertrophy/&quot;&gt;Jacob Schepis also embarked on his own 10-month high volume arm specialization routine&lt;/a&gt;, where biceps and triceps each got about 30 weekly sets (about 15 direct and 15 indirect).  Here is visible evidence of his results (and this is in a well trained individual!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jacob-schepis-hypertrophy-1024x559.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application:  A Moderate Volume Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might you apply this information to structuring a training program for maximizing hypertrophy?  Here&#39;s one example of how you might structure a program that uses the best &amp;quot;bang for your buck&amp;quot; range of 10-20 weekly sets per muscle group.  This particular example is a 4-day upper/lower split; most muscle groups are trained via combination of compound and isolation movements.  Total weekly set volume is 16 for most muscle groups.  Sets per muscle  training session are around 8.  Sets are stopped around 1-2 reps short of failure to allow for better recovery, and repetitions and exercises are varied to help reduce joint stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying a program like this, considering using a volume ramp method. Start with 1-2 sets per exercise. Either on a weekly basis, or as you hit plateaus, add one set per exercise. Continue to do this until you hit 8 sets per muscle group or until you&#39;ve done two successive 20% increases in set volume with no further progress. Once you&#39;ve hit a plateau that you can no longer break through, then consider reducing volume again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Moderate-volume-program-example-1-1024x691.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Application: High Volume Arm Specialization Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, upper body is trained three times per week (one day is a dedicated arm day) and lower body twice per week.  Total arm volume is approximately 26 sets for triceps and 32 sets for biceps  (counting both indirect and direct movements).  Other muscle groups are in the 12-18 range.  Sets per training session does not exceed 10 per muscle group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://weightology.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/arm-specialization-1024x647.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping It Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that about does it for the most thorough review on training volume and hypertrophy that you&#39;ll find anywhere.  You can be sure that this will be updated as new research becomes available.  Conclusions in science are always tentative, and based on the best available evidence at the moment.  &lt;strong&gt;In the case of set volume and hypertrophy, more is better up to around 6-8 hard sets per training session with long rests and twice as much with short rests.&lt;/strong&gt; High weekly volumes (20+ weekly sets) give best results when split into frequencies of at least 3 days per week.  Of course, this is based on averages, and individuals may respond very differently to changes in volume compared to the average.  It&#39;s also important to point out that &lt;strong&gt;12-18 weekly sets probably gives you the best bang for your buck in terms of hypertrophy relative to the time investment when hitting each muscle 2-3 days per week&lt;/strong&gt;.  If you&#39;re looking to do some very high volume training, &lt;strong&gt;specialization is the most realistic method of achieving high weekly volumes for a particular muscle group&lt;/strong&gt;.  Also, regardless of how you program volume, &lt;strong&gt;the needs of the individual must be considered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Things I Wish I Knew 8 Years Ago</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/thingsiwishiknew/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/thingsiwishiknew/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been seriously lifting weights for eight years now. Looking back at when I first started, I did so many things wrong but it took me a lot of trial and error to get where I&#39;m at today. By no means do I know everything now -- not even close. I finished school with a BS in Kinesiology and got my CSCS from the National Strength and Conditioning Association, and will start my Master&#39;s program in the fall. There have been many times where I was dead-set on being right about things, only to later find out I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the beauty of exercise and strength training: continuing to learn and grow. You should never be complacent with what you know. Buy books, read articles, ask around your gym. You can only benefit from this. You can add to what you already have in your arsenal and become a complete package. Here are some things I wish I knew when I started 8 years ago. (Disclaimer: this is mainly directed at beginners, but some of these things may be new to you even if you&#39;ve been lifting for some time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just because your numbers are going up doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re doing the exercise right.&lt;/strong&gt; I remember hitting plenty of milestones in regards to benching, squatting, and deadlifting. However, I would later find out little things I was doing wrong that could have led to injury. Fixing these minor tweaks made the exercises much harder, but I felt much stronger and safer because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility work is extremely important.&lt;/strong&gt; After a couple years of lifting, I was at the top of the world. I was bigger, stronger, had more confidence, etc. However, I didn&#39;t realize how tight I was, and how that was restricting much of what I did in the weight room and in my life. If you don&#39;t know much about mobility, do some research. Thoracic spine mobility, shoulder mobility, hip mobility, ankle mobility, the list goes on and on. Look up people like Kelly Starrett, Eric Cressey, Matthew Ibraham, and others. They all have YouTube channels and their attention to detail in regards to range of motion, stability, and mobility are some of the most useful and eye-opening pieces of information you can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never underestimate the power of warming up.&lt;/strong&gt; I see a lot of people walk into the gym, do a couple of shoulder circles, then jump into their workout. I used to do the same thing. However, once I started adding in dynamic warmups and prehab/mobility exercises before lifting, I noticed a world&#39;s difference. Consider the exercises you&#39;ll be doing that day and work on those areas before you hit the weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compound movements really do trump all.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a hard lesson for me to learn. I used to do the typical back/biceps, chest/triceps, shoulders/traps, legs split (which, depending on your goals, isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing). However, once I switched over to Push/Pull/Leg splits, I really noticed a change in my body. Cut down the isolation work. Focus on exercises that will truly challenge your strength, stability, and coordination. Pull ups, chin ups, bent over rows, squats, deadlifts, RDLs, overhead presses, bench/incline bench, pushups, dips, cleans, snatches, etc. Those are the exercises that should make up the majority of your workouts. Find ways to make them harder if you&#39;ve already mastered them. Not only will your strength increase, but you&#39;ll look even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best core work you can do (in terms of both safety and results) doesn&#39;t involve crunches and russian twists&lt;/strong&gt; Just hear me out on this one. I used to do the usual ab exercises -- sit ups, crunches, leg raises, russian twists, side bends, etc. While these will all work your abs, they do little to nothing to help your overall core stability. Start using movements that will help you in your other lifts (and they will strengthen and grow your abs as well). These movements refer to anti-extension/flexion, anti-rotation, rotational movements, etc. I&#39;ve been doing these exercises for my core and have noticed my other lifts improve because of them (in addition to being extremely sore the next day): Hanging leg raises, Pallof presses, landmine rotations, woodchops, planks on a stability ball, rollouts (wheel or stability ball), dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions, dragonfly&#39;s, rotational throws, plank slides with gliders, side planks, farmer carries, overhead carries, L sits, etc. A lot of these can be done on one knee or can be made harder by taking away an arm or leg. Basically, any exercise that challenges your body&#39;s ability to stay stable has a profound effect on your overall strength and still give you that ab soreness that so many people desire (even though that&#39;s not what we&#39;re after..but you know what I&#39;m saying). Another note on this: people tend to think of the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; as just your abs. But your core is actually all of the structures that support your trunk and limbs. This includes your abdominals, obliques, shoulder joints, hip joints, lower back muscles, etc. By strengthening these areas, you improve your trunk rigidity. When your trunk rigidity increases, it allows more freedom of movement from your limbs. All proximal tightness will improve distal ROM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kettlebells are AWESOME&lt;/strong&gt; I avoided kettlebells for a very long time up until these past few years. Talk about a game-changer. Kettlebells allow you to do some crazy movements that&#39;ll challenge your body in ways that you didn&#39;t think possible. Kettlebell swings are towards the top of my list. Not only are they great for glute strength/power, but it has a carryover effect for teaching proper hip hinge mechanics, and is a great tool to add in for high intensity conditioning. Turkish get ups, windmills, clean and presses, one-armed presses, goblet squats (great for beginners), and many other exercises challenge you in a unique way. If you haven&#39;t tried training with kettlebells, I recommend you start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio really, really, really does not have to be a drag&lt;/strong&gt; I know a lot of people have recently moved away from the long duration treadmill, elliptical, stair-stepper, and biking trend that has dominated the fitness culture for so long. But a lot of people still limit themselves to just that. Circuits and HIIT are truly superior if you want to add in cardio work. Not only is it faster, but it&#39;s way less boring and much more fun and effective. Some ideas of exercises to use for your conditioning: PROWLER PUSHES, kettlebell swings, rower intervals, ball slams (both front and side to side), plyometric work, speed ladders, tire flips, mountain climbers, box jumps, sprints, battle ropes, jump ropes, sled pulls (with a rope, working primarily your back), etc. These will not only leave you gassed but also work your entire body instead of just your legs. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing out, or following, a detailed workout program will get you to that next level&lt;/strong&gt; I can&#39;t tell you how many of my workouts in years past consisted of me walking into the gym and meandering from exercise to exercise. Sure I walked out with a nice pump, but how did I know I actually made any progress. When I follow a pre-written routine, I go into the gym on a mission. I know what I&#39;m going to do, how many times, and how much weight I&#39;ll use. This really drills discipline into you. Some days you come in feeling sluggish, but if you have a routine set up, you know that you must finish what you wrote down. Otherwise, you&#39;d probably cut your workout short. Having a specific goal changes your mindset completely. Tracking your progress keeps you honest and prepared. Looking back on your numbers and seeing them increase is an awesome feeling. Look into programs like 5/3/1, starting strength, PHAT, just to name a few. Or, if you feel competent enough, write up your own. Take progress pictures. Track your numbers. It is essential for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn your damn anatomy.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of things really started clicking for me once I began studying anatomy and physiology. Although it may be boring, once you learn about where each bone is, where your muscles originate and insert, how the contraction process takes place, etc. then you will start viewing lifting in a whole new light. Biomechanics is a big one too. These things can change how you lift and help you pay more attention to your technique. For instance, you know you need to keep your elbows back to target your triceps during dips, but do you know WHY? Did you know that your pec actually inserts onto your humerus (arm bone) therefore when you keep your arms close you&#39;re essentially taking the pec out of [majority of] the movement? Not only will this help you, but it will help if someone ever needs advice or has any &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; questions. Do your muscles flex? Well, no they don&#39;t. Your joints flex and extend. Your muscles contract and relax. Find out the function of each muscle, what muscles contribute to elbow/shoulder/hip/knee extension and flexion, and you&#39;ll learn a lot of new things. Look up websites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbodysmart.com/&quot;&gt;getbodysmart.com&lt;/a&gt; which have great illustrations of muscle function and placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition and sleep really are as important as people make them out to be.&lt;/strong&gt; I know, I know. Everyone has heard this by now. But I had to mention it. Just google the benefits of sleep if you don&#39;t know them, but they are substantial. Nutrition..well, I could write an entire essay on that subject alone but you must, and I mean MUST make this a priority over everything else. If you have your nutrition on point, everything else will come with relative ease. Don&#39;t undermine its importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing mechanics are important.&lt;/strong&gt; This is one that I&#39;ve really had to learn to incorporate lately. And I&#39;m not talking about the typical &amp;quot;exhale when exerting/using concentric contractions and inhale during lowering/eccentric contractions. I&#39;m talking about proper breathing and rib alignment. Google or YouTube proper breathing mechanics and setup. 90/90 breathing is a great exercise to use. Most of us here are chest breathers, when in reality we need to be using our diaphragms. This will change the way you do pretty much every exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Film yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m adding this one a day late because it totally slipped my mind last night. There&#39;s a difference between what you feel like you&#39;re doing and what you&#39;re ACTUALLY doing. The best way to find out the truth is to film yourself from the side. This is such a big help, especially if you&#39;re wondering how your form is. Try to have a friend film you squat or deadlift in slow motion, and watch the video carefully. Look at how you initiate the movement, if/when you start rounding your back, how your head position looks, etc. Or, you can even film yourself doing these exercises in your room with no weight. Although it may sound weird, doing certain exercises with a shirt off will actually show you the muscles themselves moving, and if you do an exercise from a rear view you can see your spinal mechanics at work. It&#39;s really an interesting thing to do and will help you spot any errors and correct your form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I could think of for now, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot more. I figured if it was longer than this I&#39;d lose your attention (unless I already lost you a long time ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, by no means do I know everything. Not even close. But in order to be the best you can be in the world of physical fitness, you must continue to learn and experiment. Be proud of where you are, but ask yourself what aspects you&#39;re ignoring or could improve. Much love &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/&quot;&gt;r/fitness&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m constantly amazed at the amount of support and passion you guys have for the subject and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone. Hope you are all having a wonderful Christmas season. It is a time for family to get together as well as eat a lot of food. However, I hope everyone has been keeping fit. As usual, I&#39;ve collected a few, very recent studies about fitness, health and nutrition to condense them into easy-to-read summaries for all of you. I hope to create some discussion below! Any tips for writing, presentation, analysis or anything else would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;squat&quot;&gt;Squat &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#squat&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squat depth is a contentious subject in the fitness literature due to its uncertainties in the context of injury risk, muscle hypertrophy, strength gains, translation into sports performance and more. The literature teeters to both ends of the spectrum as Hartmann et al. (2012) showed superior functional adaptations for the full squat when compared to shallower squats. However, more recently, Rhea et al. (2016) found that quarter squats may actually be better for improving sprinting and jumping. Thus, Pallarés et al. (2019) sought to clear up the doubt by comparing full squats, parallel squats and half squats with the following outcomes in mind: one repetition maximum, maximum propulsive velocity, jump tests, sprint tests, Wingate tests as well as physical disability measurements as a proxy for injury risk. Let’s just quickly go over what some of this means. A full squat in the context of this study is a very deep squat where the thighs meet the calves on the descent. A parallel squat is where the crease made at the groin is in line with the top of the knee. A half squat is descending until your knee joint forms a 90deg angle. The outcomes will be explained as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 men with a squat training history were recruited and split into four groups: full squat, parallel squat, half squat and a control group. The control group obviously did not partake in any resistance training so we can see if external factors that are not being measured are at play. Training was twice a week for ten weeks and the load slowly increased from 60% to 80% of their one repetition maximum. Participants did 4–5 sets of 4–8 repetitions with four minutes of rest between sets. An interesting aspect of this study is that instead of determining one repetition maxima traditionally (lifting heavier and heavier until you cannot lift against the resistance, essentially paying attention to the load lifted), they used mean propulsive velocity which just means they measured the speed at which the bar moves and once it slows enough, we have determined the one repetition maximum. This is better because we can track objective variables and numbers here. Using this velocity-based method is valid as it was used in a study with the same lifts recently and it showed a close relationship with the traditional, load-based method (Martínez-Cava et al., 2019). Several familiarization sessions were done to learn the exercises before the ten week training programme began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full squat group saw improvements across all outcomes. They increased their one repetition maximum in all three types of squats. They had better sprints and jumps as well as better Wingate test results. The wingate test is essentially a test for power (work done over time) on a cycling machine. The parallel squat group had similar results to the full squat group though to smaller extents. The half squat group made did not make great strength gains even for the half squat one repetition maximum. The power hardly changed and the peak power actually decreased. Jump heights improved slightly however, the sprint times were unchanged. The half squat group actually saw the worst results when it came to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index is a series of likert scales (ratings of subjective feeling) initially used in hospitals to evaluate pain, stiffness and functional disability in osteoarthritis (joint degeneration, generally in knees, hips and hands) patients, however, it has been used for a wide variety of rheumatological disorders. The half squat group saw large increases in all variables measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, unlike the other groups. Deeper squats may not have an increased knee injury risk despite higher knee flexion angles because of various reasons. The wrapping effect is a mechanism in which the quadriceps tendon makes better contact with the femur as we descend further in the squat rendering the knee joint more stable. The soft-tissue contact between the calf and the thigh in a deep squat may also provide support (Hartmann, Wirth &amp;amp; Klusemann, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like previous studies, there was a degree of specificity that came to light. Groups made the best strength gains at the depth they trained at. However, the full squat group still made better strength gains in the half squat if we make group to group comparisons. Another point to note is that the control group had several decrements in performance due to detraining. This further reinforces the idea that the trained population will suffer in performance after extended periods of sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: The deeper you go in a squat, the better your outcomes (strength, sprints, power, jumping) and this is likely without an increased risk for injury. (Reminder that this study was only done in trained men so keep that mind with application to populations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;spine-flex-and-back-pain&quot;&gt;Spine flex and back pain &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#spine-flex-and-back-pain&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexion of the lumbar spine (basically the spine segment located in the lower back) has long been thought to be associated with lower back pain. This has led to interventions in occupational health (“proper” biomechanics and use of braces) as well as in the fitness world especially in exercises such as the deadlift. However, is the association at hand really as strong as we think? Saraceni et al. (2019) very recently conducted a meta-analysis (pooling studies together) / review on the literature regarding this very question. They specifically aimed to see i) if lumbar flexion is a risk factor for lower back pain and ii) if the degree of lumbar flexion is different between those with or without lower back pain. In total, they managed to gather 12 studies with a total of 697 participants for analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was deemed to be low, however, there was no evidence to suggest that lumbar flexion was a risk factor for lower back pain though lumbar load may be a risk factor. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Critically, to date no study that has directly measured the lumbar spine during lifting, has found a relationship between LBP and greater lumbar flexion”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with lower back pain, on average, actually flexed slightly less at the lumbar spine when lifting. Unfortunately, this finding was clouded in heterogeneity which means that the papers that were pooled together in analysis were conducted so differently from each other that it becomes difficult to put them together. This finding may also be a result of reverse causality i.e: people with lower back pain flex less because of the pain, not the other way around. Careful applications of this study into resistance training world must be done as the maximum load of all the studies included was 12 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: No evidence to suggest a relationship between the degree of lumbar flexion and low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blood-flow-restriction&quot;&gt;Blood flow restriction &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#blood-flow-restriction&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood flow restriction training is gaining more traction in the training world as more and more studies appreciate its efficacy. It is executed by partially occluding the targeted muscle(s)’ blood supply (via tourniquet or other means) and training with this occlusion. It has its place in recreational training as well as in rehabilitation as it allows healing joints/tissues to exercise with lighter loads while still reaping the benefits you would receive from higher loads. An important aspect to consider, however, is the effect of blood flow restriction training on the tendons involved. This is critical because if muscle adapts to a greater extent then its tendons do, an imbalance between the structures may lead to injury. Centner et al. (2019) took 38 untrained men and separated them into three groups: a group that trained with 70–85% of one repetition maximum loads with normal resistance training, a group with 20–35% of one repetition maximum loads with blood flow restricted training and one control group. The training groups followed their respective exercise programmes for 14 weeks. The traditional resistance training group did three sets of standing calf raises and three sets of sitting calf raises with 6–12 repetitions each. For the other group, the scheme was similar but one set of 30 repetitions was done before each exercise so in total eight sets would be done as opposed to six in the other group. 15 repetitions were done for the rest of the sets. The pressure used was set at a 50% occlusion and was kept on between sets but not between exercises. Training was held three times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 14 weeks, the achilles tendon (the tendon which joins the calf muscle to the ankle) cross-sectional area grew similarly between training groups. The same can be said about gastrocnemius (calf muscle) cross-sectional area, muscle stiffness and maximum voluntary torque (force produced by calf muscle). Young’s modulus changes (stress divided by strain, a property that tells us the stiffness of a material) was said to be statistically insignificant between and within groups though the high load training group had an increased Young’s modulus while the blood flow restricted group’s had decreased. Increases in stiffness are likely because of the increased size of the tendon rather than any changes in the material properties of the tendon. The tendon adaptations we find in the blood flow restricted group may be explained by the theory of metabolic stress inducing an increased production of fibroblasts, a cell which supports a tendon’s integrity by synthesizing collagen and other structural proteins. A valuable part of the study that is missing is another group that trains with low loads but without blood flow occlusion as that would help isolate the variable of blood flow occlusion from other variables such as load. Another limitation that the authors highlighted was that the method of measuring tendon cross-sectional changes (via ultrasound) is not the most accurate technique especially when compared to sensitive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Positive tendon adaptations still occur in those who do blood flow restricted training (for young, untrained men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-——————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimum-effective-training-scheme&quot;&gt;Minimum effective training scheme &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#minimum-effective-training-scheme&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we have begun to realize that muscle hypertrophy does not require as much as we thought for it to occur. Low volumes, low frequencies, low repetitions, high rest — they all seem to work. Even intensities as low as 30% of your 1 repetition maximum are enough to induce hypertrophy (Mitchell et al., 2012). Can the same be said about muscle strength? Androulakis‑Korakakis, Fisher &amp;amp; Steele (2019) performed a meta-analysis and review on the subject amassing six different studies total. It was found that volume as low as one set of 8–10 repetitions per week for 10 weeks was enough for muscle strength to increase. All sets in the studies were done to muscle failure. Most studies had some form of progression between training sessions. Loads were generally within the 70–90% 1 repetition maximum range so if strength changes can reliably occur at lower loads (&amp;lt;60% 1 repetition maximum) is a question that still has yet to be answered. This point may be moot from an efficiency standpoint as working with lower loads would require higher repetitions to failure thus taking up more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also do not know if we can get significant strength gains at repetitions lower than five to six assuming while still maintaining a frequency of one set per week. Furthermore, these findings are limited to the squat and bench press only, the deadlift unfortunately does not have enough research to make any concrete statements. Most of this data was gleaned from trained athletes, however, while they were technically “resistance-trained”, their personal records and training history would only be considered to be at an intermediate level from an advanced perspective. Despite having few studies to work with, all the studies were of high methodological quality. One final limitation is that these results can only be extrapolated to males. The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;The authors make a recommendation that the minimum effective training scheme would be to train one set of 6–12 repetitions 2–3 times a week at a high intensity of effort (most likely in the 70–90% one repetition maximum range).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;calorie-surplus&quot;&gt;Calorie surplus &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#calorie-surplus&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bodybuilding, it is often recommended to eat at a caloric surplus (ie. eating more calories than you burn daily) while training. This is sound advice because your body does need more energy for building the new tissue, maintaining the tissue and dealing with the altered metabolism that the body undergoes with training and muscle tissue accretion. However, there are a lot more variables that go into this and there is an immense amount of nuance. Slater et al. (2019) aimed to present and discuss all the variables as well as unravel all the confusion. Do we need a surplus in the first place? It would seem so given the theory above. Energy restrictions have been shown to interfere with muscle protein synthesis but this can be alleviated with training and a higher protein intake. So it is likely still possible to experience hypertrophy in a caloric deficit but this is probably only reasonably applicable to the overweight or untrained (more research needed!). Despite eating a caloric surplus being ubiquitous as a guideline, it is interesting to note that there is no controlled trial where they studied the relationship between a caloric surplus and muscle hypertrophy from resistance training over an extended period of time. However, we can look at overfeeding studies where participants are eating at a caloric surplus while not resistance training. In these studies, we do see gains in fat-free mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are mathematical formulae out there to calculate what is the ideal surplus for your hypertrophy goals, however, no formulae takes into account all the complex biological processes that occur with muscle hypertrophy. These formulae are also based off of people who do not resistance train. Metabolism can be vastly different in athletes. For example, diet-induced thermogenesis (heat produced/calories burnt simply from eating) can be higher for athletes as their protein intakes are generally higher (takes more energy to digest protein). There is also the question of how you should distribute the surplus throughout the day or week. For example, carbohydrates may be good before or during high volume training yet there is no strong research in that area. Another common example is having a larger surplus on training days to make up for the training. The macronutrient distribution of the surplus is also relevant. The authors recommend 4–7 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 35% of caloric intake with fat and 1.6 g/kg/day of protein. Three meals spread across the day with snacks interspersed between also appears to be effective. In total, a 360–480 daily calorie surplus seems to be an appropriate number to start with but it requires constant review throughout the training programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Not a lot is known about a caloric surplus and its effects on muscle hypertrophy while training. However, a small surplus of 360–480 kcal/day with appropriate macronutrient distribution appears to be a good starting point for most people wanting to build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Review of Recent Fitness Studies VI Squats, Foam Rolling &amp; Training to Failure</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, some of you may remember me for making these kinds of posts awhile back. I have still been reading a lot and I wanted to write up another post for everyone again. As usual, this is solely for educational purposes and I hope to encourage a lot of discussion below. Something cool to note is that all of these papers were published this year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short review on training to failure and its implications on muscle hypertrophy (muscle growth) by Schoenfeld &amp;amp; Grgic (2019) was recently published. Training to failure is the method of training where repetitions within a set are done until proper form in the exercise cannot be executed. This practice is actually rather common in training programmes because it is theorized that it accumulates more metabolic stress in the muscles and has higher motor unit recruitment. Metabolic stress and hypertrophy do not have a simple relationship as of now even though it is commonly thought that more metabolic stress would lead to more hypertrophy. Motor unit recruitment is how the body will activate specific motor units in order according to the load the muscles must overcome. A motor unit is defined by the muscle fibers that are stimulated by one motor neuron (a nerve, essentially). According to Henneman’s size principle, fatigue-resistant, small, weaker motor units will be recruited first and if required, larger and stronger motor units will be activated. In the context of failure, load is important because high loads (failure or not) will recruit all motor units immediately which makes the motor unit recruitment benefit of failure, null. It is important to describe what the literature generally compares training to failure against. A common alternative is a technique where the endpoint of a set is where you believe you can only do one or two more repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that studies showing training to failure to be superior have some design issues. For example, Goto, Ishii, Kizuka, Takamatsu (2005) had these results but the group that did not train to failure had inter-repetition rest which does not reflect how people usually train. Normally, you would complete all your repetitions and rest once the entire set is completed. It is possible that without the inter-repetition rest, both groups would have had similar hypertrophy outcomes. There are studies where both methods result in similar hypertrophy amongst participants. Nobrega et al. (2018) had 32 participants perform either high loads or low loads to failure or not to failure in leg extensions. Quadricep cross-sectional area was similar between failure and non-failure conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, there clearly is not enough data to infer any solid conclusions regarding training to failure. Regardless, some potential practical implications are the use of frequency and exercise selection for failure. Training to failure can be taxing on the body. Izquierdo et al. (2006) had a group training to failure twice a week for 16 weeks and they had a lower number of hormones like testosterone that would help with muscle growth. Therefore, if failure is in a training programme, it may be wise to limit its use to once a week, once every other week or at the end of a mesocycle (a programme) where you are peaking with volume. Exercise selection may also be important as failure for multi-joint movements such as the bench press or the squat may be more taxing than single-joint movements like a bicep curl or a leg extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Hard to say if training to failure has any benefits over training just shy of failure. Regardless, it can be dangerous if used improperly so its implementation into a training programme must be done carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common response to fatigue from strenuous exercise is to consume water. The body becomes dehydrated over time with intense activity and it is important to rehydrate. However, is it possible that plain water consumption may have an adverse effect on the body during/after exercise? Lau, Kato &amp;amp; Nosaka (2019) recently investigated the effects of water consumption on exercise-associated muscle cramps and how water compares to an oral rehydration solution (Gatorade).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous hypotheses suggested that exercise-associated muscle cramps were related to electrolyte abnormalities (diminished minerals like sodium or potassium during exercise). Unfortunately, amongst several problems, electrolyte abnormalities would not explain such a localised manifestation (a cramp in only one muscle) rather than a systemic one and it would not explain why stretching the muscle provides relief. Modern theory proposes that it is more of a neural disorder where there is an imbalance between the golgi tendon organ and the muscle spindles. The golgi tendon organ is located at both ends of muscles and it serves to prevent over-contraction. Muscle spindles are wrapped around the muscle fibres which perform the opposite (prevents over-stretching).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, it would be careless to completely eliminate electrolytes from the equation in regards to exercise-associated muscle cramps. In this study, 10 healthy men drank either water or Gatorade after downhill running in a cross-over fashion (all 10 participants would try both beverages, one beverage one week and another the next week). Blood tests would be done before, immediately after and 80 minutes after the run. To determine the intervention’s effect on cramps, electrical stimulation would be applied to calf until a cramp could be induced otherwise known as the threshold frequency. If the threshold frequency was lower, it would imply that you were more susceptible to cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydration had no effect on cramp susceptibility. Cramp susceptibility increased with water but decreased with Gatorade. Cramp susceptibility actually decreased lower than baseline with Gatorade. This reduced cramp susceptibility is unlikely related to electrolytes because Gatorade did not actually increase electrolytes to a significant extent according to the blood tests. Gatorade did, however, have glucose which may have had an effect on cramp susceptibility. This, along with how long cramp susceptibility is increased with water, should be looked into more scrupulously in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Water intake after exercise may actually lead to a higher chance of having exercise-associated muscle cramps when compared to Gatorade intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squats are a popular lower-body exercise as it increases lower body strength, stimulates lower body hypertrophy and has good translation into the performance of important movements like jumping. There has been some doubt as to what is the optimal range of motion for a squat. Deep squats have been shown to have higher muscle activation but it is not entirely impossible that shallow squats lead to comparable strength/muscle size gains. Kubo, Ikebukuro &amp;amp; Yata (2019) sought out to compare the two squat variations amongst 17 healthy males. The participants were either put into a group that did deep squats (knee angle of around 140 degrees) or a group that did shallow squats (knee angle of around 90 degrees, about parallel). The groups were matched according to baseline characteristics and physical ability. Subjects were physically active but none of them followed any specific training programme within the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire programme lasted 10 weeks with a training frequency of twice a week. Two familiarization sessions were done before the 10 weeks to get used to proper squat form and to determine 1 repetition maxes (maximum load you can squat within one repetition). Each proper training session involved three sets. Participants worked up to 90% of their 1 repetition maximum for 8 repetitions for a few weeks. 5kg would be added to the load if they could complete the 8 repetitions. Outcomes measured were squat 1 repetition maxima and various muscle sizes including all the quadriceps, the hamstring muscles, hip adductors and the gluteus maximus. This study is the first to directly measure glute and hip adductor hypertrophy in response to squats. Muscle size was measured with serial MRI images which is the gold standard for muscle size measurement as it can differentiate between muscles and distinguish muscle, intramuscular fat and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep squat group had greater improvements in the deep squat 1 repetition maximum, around 20% better. However, both groups improved in the shallow squat 1 repetition maximum to a similar degree. Quadricep muscles grew about the same between groups. The rectus femoris did not grow to a significant extent in either group (which is in-line with previous research). This is likely because the rectus femoris muscle is a biarticular muscle (a muscle which crosses two joints). When you ascend in the squat, the rectus femoris will try to contract to help with knee extension but it will also stretch as the hip extends. This leads to the muscle being about the same length throughout the entire movement. The hamstring muscles in both groups grew similarly. The gluteus maximus and the hip adductors hypertrophied (grew) more in the deep squat group although not by much. These results can only be applied to untrained males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; In untrained males, deep squats may lead to better strength gains in the deep squat and may have better hypertrophy outcomes in the gluteus maximus as well as the hip adductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foam rolling is the use of foam cylinders, sticks, bars or various other foam equipment for self-massage either before or after exercise in hopes to improve performance or recovery. It is thought to have effects on the thixotropy of muscles which is just another way of saying that it is able to reduce muscle stiffness. They may also help with myofascial trigger points or “knots” in your muscle but the physiology behind all of this is controversial and is a story for another day. Other potential benefits is that it can reduce muscle soreness and increase blood flow to muscles. Wiewelhove et al. (2019) developed a meta-analysis on the subject to see if foam rolling really works. A meta-analysis is the pooling of several studies together to control sampling variance and to get a better idea of the data at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis was bifurcated into foam rolling before exercise and foam rolling after exercise. Pre-rolling had small effects on sprint performance and flexibility and essentially no effects on strength and jump performance. Post-rolling had small effects on sprint/strength recovery and muscle pain perception. Otherwise, post-rolling had nothing to show for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the data for foam rolling was not impressive, it is possible that foam rolling is still relevant for elite athletes. This is because very small improvements in performance are still valuable if your variation in performance is very narrow. If you are a novice, your performance is likely to be highly variable and minor improvements will not be able to manifest itself in performance. Despite all this, there are a few issues with the meta analysis. Most of the studies vary in design and how they carried out the investigations. This makes pooling the research very difficult and is known as high heterogeneity. Furthermore, since you are not able to blind study participants or investigators to foam rolling interventions, the potential for bias and placebo effects is high. Adverse effects from foam rolling should also be considered even though it is generally considered to be relatively harmless. Some populations with peripheral nerve or artery diseases may be at an increased risk for possible adverse effects from foam rolling but more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Foam rolling is likely not very beneficial for performance or recovery if you’re not an elite athlete. However, it may not hurt to do it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is an important macronutrient that amongst many processes, facilitates muscle growth and recovery. Having healthy muscles is important for completing every day tasks and this becomes increasingly critical as we age. Sarcopenia is the gradual loss of muscle mass generally associated with aging. This is tough to combat as the anabolic response to protein decreases as we age. That is to say, old people do not respond as well as their younger counterparts to an equal amount of protein. The elderly also tend to have a poor appetite towards high protein foods like meat which is related to chewing being tougher in that demographic and various metabolic issues. Researchers have taken this issue and have proceeded to look down other avenues for protein supplementation with one of these being plant-based proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berrazaga, Micard, Gueugneau &amp;amp; Walrand (2019) compiled a review of plant-based protein sources and how they fare against animal-based protein sources. While this study was more in the scope of older demographics, it is still relevant to younger people especially those who consume more plant-based foods. Animal proteins are generally more digestible. This may be because their protein structure are mainly alpha-helix based instead of beta-sheets (these are just different ways particles within proteins can be organized) which makes it easier for the body’s enzymes to digest. In regards to digestibility, however, heating the plant-based foods can make its proteins more accessible. Another issue with plant-based proteins is that they lack a variety of essential amino acids. An amino acid is the basic building block of proteins. There are 20 standard amino acids and 9 of them are labelled as “essential amino acids”. These are amino acids that cannot be synthesized within the human body and they can only be obtained from food. Some amino acids can even be essential earlier on in life but then become non-essential as our metabolic systems develop with age. Ideally, a protein source would be able to fulfill the requirements for all essential amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When put directly against animal-based proteins, the animal protein tends to have a much higher muscle protein synthesis rate after consumption. Muscle protein synthesis is the building of muscle via protein. This is only measuring an acute response but even in more long-term studies, animal protein still outdoes plant protein. To alleviate these problems, it has been suggested to simply eat more protein. It was found that 60g of wheat protein was as good as 35g of whey protein in the context of muscle protein synthesis. Combining different plant proteins that complement each other in regards to essential amino acid content may be a solution but has yet to be studied. Some plant proteins with genetic mutations can be selectively bred in order to have better quality protein. This strategy has been shown to work in children when measuring growth rates among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; Plant-based proteins may not be as good as animal-based proteins due to their poor digestibility and lacking essential amino acid content. Some strategies to sidestep these issues show promise but it all needs more research especially in the context of sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/musclebuilding101/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;main id=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;site-main&quot; role=&quot;main&quot;&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;post-481&quot; class=&quot;post-481 page type-page status-publish hentry&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an illusion of complexity to gaining weight and building muscle (perpetuated largely by people who want your money) but it is actually very straightforward. Your body requires a certain amount of energy (measured in calories) each day in order to fuel its activities. This is called your Total Daily Energy Expenditure or TDEE. If your diet supplies fewer calories than your TDEE (a deficit), you will lose weight. If your diet supplies more calories than your TDEE (a surplus), you will gain weight. You’ve probably heard of many different diets out there, and when they work, they all achieve weight gain in the same way – manipulating calorie balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates two points of failure to be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underestimating your TDEE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is very easy to do. Just remember, always, that no TDEE calculation is 100% accurate. Treat them as estimates only and don’t get fixated on what a calculator told you if it conflicts with what you’re seeing on the scale. Calculations of calorie burn during exercise, in particular, tends to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt; inaccurate and inflated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overestimating your calorie consumption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most commonly this happens when people pay inadequate attention to what they’re eating. This ranges from eyeballing portion sizes to simply not tracking calorie consumption at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whichever it is, the most important fact to remember is that &lt;strong&gt;the scale doesn’t lie&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to maintain or lose weight while eating at a true surplus, it would require your body to break the laws of the universe by making energy vanish into thin air. You can read further in our FAQ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/faq/why-cant-i-gain-weight/&quot;&gt;Why can’t I gain weight?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;Resistance_Training&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Resistance Training&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece of the puzzle is adding resistance training to your life. If you simply start eating more without giving your body a stimulus to build muscle, all you’ll do is get fat. That stimulus is resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of debate on the internet about the most optimal and efficient muscle building routines. The truth lies in the old adage – “Many roads lead to Rome”. Most of the sensible routines you can find out there work well if you commit to them and give them time. r/Fitness has a rich history of progress threads that prove a person can build muscle on just about any proven routine. Even better, “gym bros” everywhere have proven repeatedly that you can run some of the dumbest routines imaginable and still make good progress if you are trying hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it doesn’t matter much&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; routine you follow, it’s still important that you do follow a structured routine. You can read more about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/adding-physical-activity/#The_Importance_of_Having_a_Program&quot;&gt;Importance of Having a Program&lt;/a&gt; section of the Adding Physical Activity page. A list of reliable, good quality routines that r/Fitness users commonly recommend can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/&quot;&gt;Recommended Routines – Strength Training / Muscle Building&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section&quot; id=&quot;Protein&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Protein&lt;span class=&quot;ez-toc-section-end&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to ensure that you eat enough protein each day to fuel the process of building muscle. To maximize the benefit for building muscle, you’ll want to consume at least 160g or 0.8g/lb, whichever is greater. You can read more about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/#Macronutrients&quot;&gt;Macronutrients &lt;/a&gt;section of the Improving Your Diet page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your quest to build muscle, keep in mind that there is nothing special about protein powders or mass gainers. Quite literally, they are nothing more than powdered food. The only advantage the offer over any other protein source is convenience – they’re easy to prepare, transport, store, and consume. That’s it. They are just a potential tool you could use to meet your protein or calorie needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your “before” measurements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These can be any measurements you want, but should at least include weight and photos of front, back, and side (in underwear is ideal).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimate your TDEE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Remember to treat this as an estimate only, and keep in mind the adage “No plan survives engagement with the enemy”. Expect to have to adjust this number over time. In particular, expect it to be higher as you gain weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a daily calorie goal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;The best place to start is by increasing your TDEE by 10-20% (TDEE x 1.1-1.2). You will usually want to avoid going above 20% more than your TDEE. Going too far above your TDEE will lead to increased fat gain, and could make it very difficult to eat enough food without discomfort. Muscle builds very slowly, so don’t think that more food always = more muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a daily protein goal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Shoot for a bare minimum of 160g per day of protein, ideally spread across four meals. Up to 0.8g/lb per day has been shown to be beneficial for building muscle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your calorie and protein consumption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tools such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfitnesspal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nutritiondata.self.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;NutritionData&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are very useful for tracking calories. We also recommend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8EbfzFB0mBrMGJ6V2N5QWNfeTg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3-Suns Adaptive TDEE Spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, which will adjust its estimate of your TDEE over time. Track&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; you eat and drink, including additives and toppings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take regular progress measurements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Weight should generally be measured once a day (or at least once a week), preferably unclothed and on an empty stomach. Don’t sweat day-to-day fluctuations – &lt;strong&gt;track the trend over time&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Monthly progress photos may be worth considering. Avoid any handheld or scale based body fat percentage measurements – the bio-electrical impedance method is extremely inaccurate and inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjust your diet over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you gain weight, your TDEE will inevitably go up – more mass requires more calories to fuel. This means that your starting calorie goal will eventually no longer cause weight gain, and you will need to adjust it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be patient and do not expect progress to be fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While you can gain &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pretty quickly, gaining actual muscle is a different story. You should not expect to gain more than ~2 lbs of pure muscle per month. Additionally, you should not expect to start seeing visual changes for at least the first month, and no&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;noticeable&lt;/em&gt; changes for at least the first 2-3 months. Don’t let this discourage you.&lt;br&gt;

		<title>Is fruit juice healthier than whole fruit?</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/juicevsfruits/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/juicevsfruits/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, fruit juice is not healthier than whole fruit in general. Even if the juice is freshly squeezed on the spot, drinking the juice is less healthy than eating the fruit whole. You may be tempted into thinking that since fruit juice comes straight from the fruit, they must be nutritionally equivalent. But such thinking is wrong. There are two main reasons for this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the pulp and skin of the fruit that is left behind is high in dietary fiber. Dietary fiber plays a larger role than just promoting regular bowel movements. When you eat a fruit whole, the dietary fiber in the pulp binds to the natural sugar in the fruit as it travels through your gastrointestinal tract. This binding action makes it harder and take longer for your body to absorb the sugar. As a result, the fruit&#39;s sugar accumulates in your blood at a lower and slower rate if you eat the fruit whole than if you drink straight fruit juice. This process lets your body use the sugar more as a direct energy source. In contrast, drinking straight fruit juice leads to a spike in blood sugar. Sensing that you have more sugar than you need, your body quickly releases insulin, leading to a large amount of the sugar in your blood being converted to fat and glycogen. In this way, the blood sugar spike leads to a blood sugar dip (unless more food is eaten), leaving you hungry again. And being hungry makes you eat more. In this way, drinking pure fruit juice leads to poorer regulation of blood sugar and increased calorie consumption, when compared to eating whole fruits. People who are especially sensitive to blood sugar levels may even suffer headaches, weakness, and irritability after drinking fruit juice, whereas these symptoms do not arise when eating the fruits whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study lead by L. F. Burroughs published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition states, &amp;quot;Healthy volunteers ingested sugar-equivalent meals of oranges and orange juice and of grapes and grape juice. Satiety, assessed by two subjective scoring systems, was greater after whole fruit than after juice and the return of appetite was delayed. With oranges, as previously reported with apples, there was a significantly smaller insulin response to fruit than to juice and less postabsorptive fall in plasma glucose.&amp;quot; Interestingly, a study lead by H. H. Stratton and published in the journal Pediatrics found that, &amp;quot;Among children who were initially either at risk for overweight or overweight, increased fruit juice intake was associated with excess adiposity gain, whereas parental offerings of whole fruits were associated with reduced adiposity gain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the pulp and skin of many fruits tends to be high in vitamins and other nutrients. Extracting just the juice leaves behind much of these nutrients. For instance, oranges are a rich source of flavonoids, but much of the flavonoids are stored in the pulp and not the juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of dietary fiber and other nutrients in the fruit&#39;s skin and pulp therefore makes whole fruit significantly healthier than fruit juice. For instance, a study lead by Qi Sun of the Harvard Medical School and published in the British Medical Journal found that:&lt;/p&gt;

	Replacing each three servings/week of fruit juice consumption with the same amount of total or individual whole fruits, the risk of type 2 diabetes in the pooled analysis was 7% (95% confidence interval 4% to 9%) lower for total whole fruits, 33% (24% to 40%) lower for blueberries, 19% (14% to 24%) lower for grapes and raisins, 14% (11% to 18%) lower for apples and pears, 13% (9% to 16%) lower for bananas, and 12% (8% to 17%) lower for grapefruit after adjustment for personal factors, lifestyle, and the modified alternate health eating index score (figure). Additionally, we found that replacing fruit juice with oranges, peaches, plums, and apricots was also associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: 18% (8% to 28%) lower for prunes, 11% (5% to 16%) lower for peaches, plums, and apricots, and 8% (4% to 12%) lower for oranges.
	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While drinking 100% fruit juice is certainly healthier than drinking soda pop or fruit-flavored beverages with artificial sweeteners, nothing beats drinking a cup of water and eating a whole fruit raw.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How To Make Gains Without A Gym</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/gainswithoutgym/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/gainswithoutgym/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are currently without gym access due to quarantines and lockdowns, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote an article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how to go about maintaining your progress or making gains without gym access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, it&#39;s not a &amp;quot;how to set up a home gym&amp;quot; article (if you have the money and space for a home gym, gym closures probably aren&#39;t affecting you much), and it&#39;s not written with the assumption that you&#39;re planning on joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/&quot;&gt;r/bodyweightfitness&lt;/a&gt; and never going to the gym again.  Rather, it&#39;s about strategies you can use to adapt &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; strength or hypertrophy training for a period of time without gym access with minimal cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since gyms are so ubiquitous (and affordable, in most places), I think most people just haven&#39;t ever had to think about how they&#39;d train for weeks or months without a gym.  However, you can do some effective training with no equipment or very minimal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; training is pretty easy; push-ups, bodyweight triceps extensions, and handstand push-ups are all good ways to train your pecs, triceps, and delts.  You can progress by increasing reps over time instead of increasing load, or you can progress to increasingly challenging variations of these exercises to increase intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pull&amp;quot; training is a little more challenging with absolutely no equipment, but is quite a bit easier if you have an over-the-doorframe pull-up bar.  Without a pull-up bar, table rows are a great option, and you can add load by loading a backpack with books or other heavy household items.  If there are trees nearby, you can do pull-ups on a tree branch (again, using a backpack for added resistance).  And if you have some large water jugs, you can use them as dumbbells for curls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower body training is more of a challenge.  Bodyweight squats probably come to mind first, but they&#39;re quite easy for people who are already in pretty good shape.  However, strict step-ups (just tapping your heel to the floor, and getting no assistance from your down leg) are WAY more challenging than a lot of people realize, even if you&#39;re just using your body weight as resistance, and are easy to progress since you probably have items of varying heights around your house.  Building toward pistols is also a great challenge.  And if you don&#39;t have knee issues, bodyweight sissy squats can also provide a great challenge to your quads.  For posterior chain training, single-leg glute bridges are surprisingly challenging, especially if performed strictly, and it&#39;s fairly easy to add load via a loaded backpack.  If you have someone or something to anchor your ankles, nordic hamstrings curls are HARD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re willing to make just one purchase, you should seriously consider a set of bands.  It would be impossible to list every exercise you can do with a set of strong resistance bands, because the list would include virtually every exercise you could do with barbells or machines.  Bands also help you add resistance or assistance to virtually all bodyweight exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of programming, progressive overload is still the name of the game.  Instead of just adding more weight to the bar, you may need to be a little more creative.  With bodyweight exercises, you can either increase reps, or increase intensity by building up to more challenging versions of the exercises you&#39;re doing.  You can also increase weight via a loaded backpack for a lot of exercises.  For band exercises, you can either add more bands into the mix, or choke up on bands to increase intensity; you can also just add reps.  In general, as long as you have an objective way to make and measure progress, you should be able to maintain muscle pretty easily, and probably keep building muscle.  In terms of strength, your maxes may be down a bit once you can get back under a bar, but as long as you maintained or built muscle, any strength decrements should simply be due to rusty motor patterns, rather than &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; strength losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as you have a good idea of the exercises at your disposal, you shouldn&#39;t need to make any huge changes to a training program.  Just sub out your current exercises for other exercises that accomplish the same basic purpose, probably change the set/rep scheme (for people on strength programs, you&#39;re probably going to be looking at higher rep ranges for the time being), and keep the gains rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/no-gym/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#39;s the link to the article again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The meat-and-potatoes of it is the list of exercises at the end that you can do with no equipment or minimal equipment.  Most of them link out to pages or videos demonstrating/explaining each exercise.  Hopefully it&#39;s useful for folks who will be without gym access for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to train while gaining/lose weight, why lean bulking sets you up for failure</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/gainingloseweight/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/gainingloseweight/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Howdy folks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some thoughts on nutrition and get some conversation started.  Over the past 11 months, I gained 15lbs of bodyweight in pursuit of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwUjeQZmbr8&quot;&gt;250lb keg press&lt;/a&gt; for a strongman competition that eventually got canceled and then a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d99HoIqJsk8&quot;&gt;axle strict press PR of 266lbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that was done, I gradually cut away bodyfat, until I ended up at about the same bodyfat as the previous year but &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vxlF982.png&quot;&gt;4lbs heavier&lt;/a&gt;.  From the photos, the emphasis on pressing seemed to pay off in terms of shoulder and trap growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did all of the above without ever counting calories or macros, and wanted to share how I go about eating and training to support that.  What I&#39;m about to share below comes from a blogpost I wrote, which may make it seem a bit disjointed, but in respect for the &amp;quot;no self-promotion&amp;quot; rules I&#39;m omitting the link to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAINING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always endeavor to phase in small changes to get results, whether it’s training or nutrition, gaining or losing weight.  So when it comes to gaining, since I’m not counting calories or macros, rather than try to eat more at eat meal, I simply try to eat more MEALS.  You can call them snacks if that makes it easier, but either way, the point is to eat food more often than when you’re maintaining weight.  Typically the first place I add a meal is between breakfast and lunch.  From there, just keep finding places between meals to add food.  Since you’re keeping your 3 meals the same, this makes measuring effectiveness super simple.  If you’re not gaining weight, add another meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this DOES get unsustainable, as you can only add so many meals until you’re just eating all the time, so when that happens, it’s again not a question of eating more OF the food you have at meals (increasing portion sizes), but, instead, adding MORE food TO the meals.  The most immediate place to do this is the pre and post training meals.  I’ll give an example with my post training meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day to day post workout shake is already somewhat elaborate, but that’s because it gives me things to TAKE AWAY when fat loss comes (will discuss later).  But let’s take it for what it is: 1 cup of milk, 2 scoops of protein, 1 scoop of PB fit and some whipped cream.  Now that I want to add weight, instead of putting that in a shaker, I put it in a bowl and I mix it with 1 cup of breakfast cereal.  I’ll eat that until I stop gaining weight with it, at which point I’ll now throw in 1 cup of oatmeal.  Eat that until I don’t gain weight with it, and now I add honey.  Etc etc.  For the pre-workout meal, you can do the exact same thing.  Add some honey toast on top of your cereal and milk, or go super dirty and go for Pop-tarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your meals that you’re already eating, you can start adding to them too as the need arises.  And again: you don’t have to mess with portion sizes at all: just add different foods.  I am a big fan of different meat protein sources in a meal, having a meal of steak and ribs, beef and chicken, pork and turkey, etc etc.  Additionally, this could be a time to introduce some less strict protein/fat sources.  Add cheese or sour cream, add half an avocado, mix some PB fit onto the food, etc etc.  Once again, stupidly simple: we’re not changing portion sizes, we’re adding more food period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAINING FOR GAINING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing to keep in mind with how I eat is that eating is ALWAYS there to support training: not the other way around.  This means, I don’t chase scale weight and I don’t aim to always gain weight each week: I train VERY hard when I want to gain weight, and then I eat the way I described above in order to recover from that training.  This allows for muscular growth, rather than the infamous “dreamer bulk”, where all that was gained is fat.  If you’re not training hard enough to grow and you’re eating like you are, you simply get fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we ensure we’re training hard enough?  When you gain weight, you have to make your body fit the program, whereas when you lose weight you make the program fit your body.  That means that, when we lose weight, we use autoregulation (will discuss specifically in that section), but for weight gain I like programs with fixed percentages, sets and reps.  Specifically programs that have all of that and are TOUGH.  The one I always advocate is Jon Andersen’s Deep Water program, which I have written of extensively in the past, and that I still maintain to this day as the most effective program I’ve ever run.  I’ve also seen it transform other lifters, so I know it’s not a fluke.  The percentage, sets and reps are all fixed on the program, and it’s a total ball buster.  The ONLY way you will get through it is if you eat big enough to recover from the workouts, and when you do that, you gain muscle.  Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 Building the Monolith is another fantastic example.  There are very few AMRAP sets in the program, everything else is fixed, and if you work at the top end of all the assistance work, it’s a brutal program where, once again, you must eat to recover.  Super Squats is yet another fine example of a program where YOU have to change yourself in order to survive the program.  I’ve never run Smolov, but from the people I’ve heard that actually made it all the way through, eating like it was a job was critical to the success of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is: don’t wing it, and don’t run a program that allows you to slack off.  PHUL, PHAT, PPL, etc, are all super popular and yet I see a bunch of kids failing to gain muscle on them, and it’s most likely because there’s too much room to slack off on them if you’re so inclined.  Those will be effective choices to come down from weight gain and maintain, but when you want to gain muscle, you need something where there’s a definite number that MUST be reached and the only way to do it is by eating big enough to recover and get there.  It’s also worth appreciating that the 4 programs I mentioned (DW, BtM, SS and Smolov) all BUILD to something at the end and have fixed lengths, vs something to be run indefinitely.  Having that sort of vector will guide weight gain well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF, for some reason, you’re simply not going to do that, then the approach with diet ALSO works with training: add stuff.  Take your root/base program and add in another day of activity (ideally conditioning, but lifting can also work).  Once you can recover from that, start adding in the “snacks” by getting some exercises BETWEEN your exercises.  This is a great time to bring in super/giant sets if you’re not already doing them, as it allows you to add in more work without adding in a whole bunch of time.  Going with the whole “snacks” thing, I tend to keep these movements on the smaller side, going for assistance work rather than adding in heavy compound work.  And you can keep adding on and on to giant sets.  I was running a 4 movement giant set on my press days of some sort of press, bodyweight dips, DB lateral raises and face pulls.  A lotta small movements will add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do this right, it’s never going to be a question of “am I gaining too much fat”, but “am I not eating enough to recover from my training.”  That’s a GOOD position to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN ARGUMENT AGAINST LEAN BULKING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fat loss remains the easiest goal to achieve.  For proof of concept, think about how many people brag about losing absurd amounts of weight and contrast that with the amount of people that can brag about building large amounts of muscle. The fact remains that fat is far easier to lose than muscle is to gain.  I’ll discuss the easy way to lose fat when I discuss fat loss in general, but once we embrace this idea, it demonstrates why the goal of lean bulking is pretty goofy.  Endeavoring to remain lean at ALL times is purely some Instagram famous silliness with trainees thinking they need to be photoshoot ready at all times.  The truth is, so long as you don’t let yourself get wildly out of control with fat growth (which, if you use the above, you will not be able to do), getting to “lean enough for the summer” shape takes weeks rather than months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, lean bulking fails because it INHIBITS the trainee from being able to pursue training related goals and, in turn, substantial physical improvement.  As I wrote above: nutrition supports training, not the other way around.  So when trainees try to take on the approach of lean bulking by only having a small caloric surplus, they grant themselves the ability to only train slightly above their normal ability, if at all.  Substantial physical growth comes about as a result of substantial training phases, and without the recovery fuel necessary to pursue these phases, the growth simply isn’t going to happen.  It means that attempts to lean bulk are attempts at mediocrity, POSSIBLY adding some insignificant amount of muscle by training exactly as hard as one had before and adding a handful of calories on top of it.  But you’re also going to most likely add a small amount of fat too with that surplus, especially with such lack of training intensity: you’re just experiencing such small growth on BOTH ends that you’re not observing any real change in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, when one trains hard enough to require a significant surplus to recover, one gets significant results in muscular growth, and can quickly trim away any excess fat before pursuing more growth.  Because, in truth, fat loss phases are like a vacation from weight gain phases, for fat loss is FAR easier.  I’ll explain in that section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOSING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have upset a LOT of people with the sentiment I’m about to share, but it’s the honest truth: fat loss is easy.  The reason being is that fat loss is about INactivity.  To GAIN weight, we had to keep doing.  We had to cook all the meals, EAT all the meals, typically clean up after the meals, do a LOT of training, etc etc.  It’s a very busy time.  For fat loss, what we do is…nothing.  It’s true: when you do nothing, you lose fat.  The real word for that is “starve”, but the point remains.  To lose fat, all we have to do is NOT eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you get hungry?  That’s fine: be hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like with weight gain, it’s about phasing things.  You don’t want to just suddenly cut out EVERYTHING you were doing when you were gaining weight, because what the hell are you going to do when weight loss stalls?  Instead, start bringing out the things that you brought in.  I do tend to cut the carbs out of the pre/post training meals first, just because they’re a quick kill and now I’ve greatly reduced carbs.  After that, you can either eliminate extra meals or the extra food at your meals, but either way it remains the same: phase things out AS NEEDED.  If you’re losing weight, keep doing what you’re doing until it doesn’t work, and then try to take away something else.  I keep protein high through the process, and will cut fats before I cut protein.  Look at leaner protein sources as needed and cut out the stuff that has extra junk associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s simply a game of patience at this point.  The weight comes off as long as you’re consistent.  It IS worth noting that, for the first couple of weeks, you’re actually going to look worse than you were when you started.  When you’re at the peak of your weight gain, your muscles are full of glycogen and water and look very full.  When you start cutting that stuff away, your muscles are going to fall flat yet you won’t have lost enough actual weight to see any impact on your midsection of muscular definition, so you’re now just a smaller chubby dude, which is a bad look.  HOWEVER, if you stay the course, that sorts itself out.  Just quit looking at yourself in the mirror so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAINING WHILE LOSING WEIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the section on weight gain, with fat loss, we have to make the training match US.  It’s no secret that food is anabolic and a source of energy, and that when we have a lot of it we can accomplish great things.  HOWEVER, we can STILL do great things in a caloric deficit: we just have to be ready to adapt to the days when our energy is low.  That means that programs that employ some manner of auto-regulation are key here, while those that employ fixed sets and reps based off percentages aren’t going to be idea.  5/3/1 does a fantastic job of accounting for this, either by using anchor programs that allow for AMRAP sets (so it’s up to you on that particular day to determine how hard you push) OR programs wherein you can select your training max at the start based off how you are performing.  Brian Alsruhe’s “Darkhorse Program” has the trainee work up to a max for THAT DAY and then uses that max to determine percentage work.  Westside Barbell for Skinny Bastards, despite the name, is about working up to maxes for the day on both the max effort and repetition effort day.  The advanced program in Deep Water is perfectly suited for this. There are other programs out there like that as well: seek them out and use them intelligently.  The point is, whereas with weight gain we were training to build ourselves up, here we train to express all that strength we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as before with weight gain training, things get taken out during weight loss training.  We have less calories, so we have less recovery, so we can’t do as much.  Conditioning workouts can get reduced in terms of intensity, volume, or frequency.  Assistance exercises can be trimmed away.  Extra training days can vanish, etc.  Wait until you need to reduce training before you do: ride it out for as long as you can, but don’t hold on longer than you should, as  that’s going to cause you to burnout.  Thankfully, fat loss is a quick process, and once you are where you want to be you can either ride that out or immediately transition back to gaining weight again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you%E2%80%99re-getting-yourself-into%3A&quot;&gt;What you’re getting yourself into: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-you%E2%80%99re-getting-yourself-into%3A&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3,300 words, 11-22 minute read time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-points%3A&quot;&gt;Key Points: &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#key-points%3A&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1) Drug-free muscular potential is influenced by the size of your frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Strength is a function of neural factors and muscular factors.  Once you’ve hit a point of diminishing returns for the neural factors, your strength potential will be determined by how much muscle you can build.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3) Based on a few simple calculations, you can get a pretty good idea of your muscular and strength potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/iStock_000023934664_Medium4-1024x622.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;  
I think almost every lifter has had this thought: “I used to be able to get bigger and stronger so easily!  But lately the gains have been slowing down dramatically, and I’ve barely made any progress in the past year.  How much bigger and stronger can I reasonably get?”
&lt;p&gt;That’s a hard question to answer objectively, but I’m going to try.  This article explains the basics of the models I’m using and makes some rough predictions.  Part 2 refines those predictions and lets you know how you can use that information to make training decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, just a smidgen of background information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much muscle you can gain largely depends on the size of your frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How strong you can get is a product of how much muscle you have, and how proficient you are with the lifts you’re using to demonstrate your strength.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first and foremost, I’ll discuss the model you can use to predict how much muscle you can put on your frame.  Then, based on that information, I’ll discuss the model you can use to predict how much more strength you can gain, and what proportion of that strength potential comes from neural/technical factors, and what proportion comes from muscular factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound complicated and confusing, but bear with me; it’s really pretty simple conceptually, and you don’t need to worry about all the math behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what%E2%80%99s-my-muscular-potential%3F&quot;&gt;What’s my muscular potential? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what%E2%80%99s-my-muscular-potential%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a variety of ways proposed to predict someone’s muscular potential.  They all give reasonably similar predictions, but there are two that I think are notably better than the others, and only one of them is user-friendly.  I’ll touch on them all so that you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-berkhan%2Fleangains-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leangains.com/2010/12/maximum-muscular-potential.html&quot;&gt;The Berkhan/Leangains Model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-berkhan%2Fleangains-model&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s probably the simplest.  Martin Berkhan (the guy who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leangains.com/&quot;&gt;Leangains.com&lt;/a&gt;) developed this model based on his observations concerning the stage weights of drug-free bodybuilders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight (kg, in shredded, stage-ready condition) = height in cm – 100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert that to fat-free mass, you’d multiply the result by .95 (to account for 5% body fat in stage-ready condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re 160cm (5’3″), you should expect to be about 60kg, with 57kg of lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this calculator to see where you’d fall using this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;fat-free-mass-index&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v26/n7/full/0802037a.html&quot;&gt;Fat Free Mass Index&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#fat-free-mass-index&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI) is probably the most well-researched of these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also relatively simple to calculate:  Fat Free Mass (in kg) divided by height (in meters) squared.  It can then be normalized by adding 6.1x(1.8-height in m) so that height doesn’t throw off the calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out your FFMI using this calculator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have gotten the idea that an FFMI of 25 is the maximum possible without drugs, largely based off of &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/1995/10000/Fat_Free_Mass_Index_in_Users_and_Nonusers_of.3.aspx&quot;&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; by Kouri et Al.  You can see how big you’d be with a normalized FFMI of 25 using this calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study compared the FFMIs of 74 nonusers to those of 83 steroid users.  None of the nonusers (which included some successful drug-free bodybuilders and strength athletes) had an adjusted FFMI over 25, whereas around half of the steroid users did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case closed?  An FFMI over 25 automatically means someone is on drugs, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kouri’s study also reports the FFMIs of top pre-steroid era bodybuilders who won the Mr. America show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-22-19.54.52.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it is possible that some of those people used steroids.  However, to quote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3dmusclejourney.com/team-bios/&quot;&gt;Eric Helms&lt;/a&gt;‘ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alanaragonblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Aug-2014-AARR-Eric-Helms-Article.pdf&quot;&gt;fantastic article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With certainty we know the majority of anabolic steroid use in the US lifting community began in the late 50s once superior synthetic steroids were produced. However, we also know top American lifters and bodybuilders experimented with testosterone as of 1954. Finally, we know testosterone use likely began as early as the late 1940s among Soviet lifters, considering the institutionalized use by their weightlifting team at the 1952 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are the confirmed records of when steroid use began. However, just because something was not recorded or corroborated does not mean it couldn’t have occurred. The Mexican hormone industry began producing more affordable testosterone in 1945, coinciding with increased public awareness of testosterone’s potential with the publication of ‘The Male Hormone.’ Thus, depending on the level of skepticism applied, one can view the 1939-1959 Mr. America FFMI’s from two perspectives. The highly skeptical can view only the 1939-1944 winners as being almost certainly drug-free, while the moderately skeptical can view the 1939-1953 winners as being almost certainly drug free…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…If we accept the 1939-1944 winners as natural, the average FFMI is 24.9, with the highest reported at 27.3. Applying moderate skepticism and accepting the 1939-1953 winners as natural, the average FFMI is 25.6, with the highest reported at 28.0. These means are not much different from the 1939-1959 group mean. In fact, the authors analyzed the FFMIs to determine if they were increasing over time. They noted: ‘There was no significant trend towards increased FFMI among the Mr. America winners over a 20-year span from 1939 to 1959 (slope = 0.044 FFMI units/yr; p = 0.44 by regression analysis).’ Thus if drug use was occurring, perhaps it wasn’t frequent or effective enough to significantly affect the aggregate FFMI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study even note that the finding of an FFMI upper limit of 25 should be viewed as preliminary, and they noted several methodological limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The possibility that some of the nonusers in their sample were actually using.  However, in their words, “It is impossible that all of the individuals in this cluster (just below 25) were lying.”  Obviously this wasn’t an issue for the Mr. America winners competing before steroids existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their sample of 74 nonusers, in their words, “Might not have been large enough to exhibit fully the upper limits of muscularity attainable naturally.”  This is a major limitation: A sample size of 74 is great for a study in this field, but certainly not enough to encapsulate the entire range of human potential.  They refer to the FFMIs of the Mr. America winners from 1939-1959, which averaged 25.4, with three people exceeding 27, and one with an FFMI of 28.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that the measured and predicted body fat percentages were off by a bit (which would affect fat free mass estimates, and thus FFMI).  However, they go on to explain that the reasonable error range wouldn’t affect the results in any meaningful way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FFMIs are likely higher for fatter individuals.  Adipose tissue isn’t 100% fat; there’s also some water, connective tissue, organelles, vascular networks, etc.  For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8148928&quot;&gt;leaner people, adipose tissue is about 50% fat by volume, and for fatter people, it’s about 85% fat by volume&lt;/a&gt;.  Interestingly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.1310060509/abstract&quot;&gt;highest fat free mass&lt;/a&gt; reported in the literature was from a sumo wrestler.  This wasn’t noted in the study, but dehydrating and glycogen depleting would have the opposite effect, reducing FFMI a bit (by about 2 points or so).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last limitation isn’t overly relevant for our purposes here: The FFMI boost from steroids would likely be different for aerobic athletes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; we get from this study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steroids seemed to give people an average increase of about 3 FFMI points (the average for the 83 steroid users was 24.8, and the average for the 74 nonusers was 21.8).  That corresponds to about 7.5-10kg of lean mass.  Of course, this doesn’t take megadosing into account (top pro bodybuilders today can have FFMIs around 40 – I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; doubt someone will hit an FFMI of 37 without drugs), but it’s likely a useful rule of thumb for most people on reasonable doses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You definitely have to pick the right set of parents to reach an FFMI of 25; however, it’s not a hard ceiling like many people believe.  We know an FFMI of at least 27.3 is achievable without steroids; there was no realistic way Stanko could have been pinning in 1944.  In all likelihood, Delinger (FFMI of 28) was drug-free as well in 1949, but if you want to be super skeptical, you can disregard him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains models have three major drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An FFMI cutoff of 25, or a cutoff of height in cm minus 100 would imply that some highly gifted drug-free athletes were, in fact, on drugs.  Multiple people exceeded those “limits” before steroids even existed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cutoff of 25 also &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; “catch” a hefty number of people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; on steroids.  In Kouri’s study, about half of the steroid users had FFMIs below 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most relevant drawback for the purposes of this article:  They’re not predictive.  Even IF 25 was a true “limit” for what’s achievable without drugs (though it’s not), that wouldn’t mean that most people could reach 25, or even get particularly close to it.  This is also the drawback of the Berkhan/Leangains model: It predicts what generally gifted people can achieve, not what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains are both useful, but they both have some major drawbacks.  In that case, what are the better options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;muscle-to-bone-ratio&quot;&gt;Muscle to Bone Ratio &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-to-bone-ratio&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the brainchild of anthropometrics researcher Francis Holway.  He’s a big enough hotshot to be quoted in David Epstein’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Sports-Gene-Extraordinary-Performance/dp/161723012X&quot;&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and he’s patient enough to put up with my pestering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His idea is that the amount of muscle you can gain is limited by how much bone you have.  To quote &lt;em&gt;The Sports Gene&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One bookcase that is four inches wider than another will weigh only slightly more. But fill both cases with books and suddenly the little bit of extra width on the broader bookcase translates to a considerable amount of weight. Such is the case with the human skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In measurements of thousands of elite athletes from soccer to weight lifting, judo, rugby, and more, Holway has found that each kilogram (2.2 pounds) of bone supports a maximum of five kilograms (11 pounds) of muscle. Five-to-one, then, is a general limit of the human muscle bookcase. The limit for women is closer to 4.1 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Holway experimented on himself, spending years in heavy weight training with a diet high in protein and supplemented by creatine. But as he closed in on five-to-one, inhaling more steaks and shakes only added fat, not muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea has a lot of intuitive appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle and bone are intrinsically linked.  For example: They arise from the same stem cell line, they grow and strengthen in response to very similar hormonal signals in puberty, osteopenia (bone weakening) and sarcopenia (muscle weakening) with age are very closely associated, muscle contractions strengthen bone, there’s evidence that muscle and bone can “talk” directly to each other via paracrine hormones, and muscles even have receptors for hormones that were once thought to affect bone almost exclusively (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990248&quot;&gt;here’s a great review&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to read more about the interactions between muscle and bone).  The exact details of their molecular interactions are still being worked out, but it’s becoming more apparent every day that muscle and bone affect each other at a very basic level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This notion also has empirical support.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/6/1012.long&quot;&gt;size of someone’s frame&lt;/a&gt; correlates with how much fat free mass they have, and it’s been found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8201909&quot;&gt;people who are more solidly-built&lt;/a&gt; prior to starting a training program gain more muscle and strength (assuming pre-training FFM corresponded to frame size in that study – a pretty safe assumption).  Bone mass has also been used as a predictor for meat yield (aka muscle mass) from livestock since the ’30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like an FFMI of 25, however, a muscle:bone ratio above 5:1 doesn’t guarantee someone’s on steroids.  Francis has drug-free athletes in his database with muscle:bone ratios nearing 5.5:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle:bone ratio is a much better indicator of someone’s ability to gain muscle because it doesn’t only consider someone’s height (like FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains model do); bone mass also reflects how wide and thick someone’s frame is.  The guy who walks into the gym for the first time as wide as he is tall likely has more potential to gain muscle than the guy who’s the same height, but looks like a zipper when he turns sideways and sticks out his tongue.  FFMI only takes those two peoples’ heights into account, whereas muscle:bone ratio reflects the sizes of their entire frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Francis has thousands of athletes in his database, it’s less likely that a muscle:bone ratio above 5.5:1 will produce a “false positive” than an FFMI of 25 – indicating someone’s on drugs when they really aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, remember that ~50% of the steroid-users in the Kouri study had FFMIs below 25.  A muscle:bone ratio of 5:1 also produces far fewer “false negatives” for people on drugs, but whose frames are too small to reach an FFMI of 25, even with the assistance of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

On the right, a muscle:bone ratio of 5:1 &quot;caught&quot; 94%.](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/12022389_419862204882003_3003619904030071801_o.jpg)
&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-38917&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Data from the 1981 World Amateur Bodybuilding Championships (formerly the IFBB Mr. Universe), one of the most prestigious shows for bodybuilders who haven’t won their pro cards yet. It’s highly likely that just about everyone in the contest was on steroids. On the left, an FFMI of 25 “caught” 61% of the participants. On the right, a muscle:bone ratio of 5:1 “caught” 94%.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle:bone ratio sounds great, right?  We could predict your muscular limits based on muscle to bone ratio, with 4:1 for women and 5:1 for men being “general” standards that most people should be able to approach; athletes in sports that don’t require a ton of heavy strength training (like swimmers, divers, etc.) approach those numbers, so most people focusing solely on getting jacked should be able to get pretty close to those figures.  Then we could pad those predictions a little by bumping that limit up to 4.5:1 for very gifted women and 5.5:1 for very gifted men, give you a prediction of muscular potential with a range of just a few kilos, and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think again.  Unfortunately, the method for measuring muscle and bone mass required by this model requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0CCIQFjAAahUKEwjmo_Kcz4zIAhULdD4KHcVoBTs&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsummit.sfu.ca%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Firitems1%2F5139%2Fb14920293.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFW3zUfVV5m2yxXZewBhSbdwoeidw&amp;amp;sig2=keUZ1u5VkredEGOroq4a_g&quot;&gt;22 separate measurements&lt;/a&gt; by a trained anthropometrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn’t you just get your bone mass measured via DEXA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.  The bone mass reading you get from DEXA is the bone’s “dry weight” – just the mineral content, rather than the entire weight of the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while muscle:bone ratio is promising, and perhaps the best method for predicting your muscular potential, it’s not very user-friendly, and basically impossible to assess on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with one final option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;casey-butt%E2%80%99s-maximum-muscular-potential-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/potential.html&quot;&gt;Casey Butt’s Maximum Muscular Potential Model&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#casey-butt%E2%80%99s-maximum-muscular-potential-model&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Butt analyzed a metric crap ton of data from drug-free bodybuilders, relying heavily on data from the pre-steroid era to find a simple way to predict your maximum muscular potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found a very strong relationship between peoples’ wrist circumference, their ankle circumference, and their muscular potential.  I’d strongly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/potential_e-book.html&quot;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; that discusses his methods in much more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/6/1012.long&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; previously linked concerning the correlation between frame size and fat free mass also supports the use of the wrist as a predictor of fat free mass:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wrist breadth is potentially the best discriminator of an association between frame size and amounts of fat and muscle, independent of stature. &lt;strong&gt;Broad wrists&lt;/strong&gt; are negatively associated with total body fat and positively associated with fat free mass and vice versa. … in the multiple regression analyses, &lt;strong&gt;wrist breadth&lt;/strong&gt; was significantly and negatively associated with TBF and significantly and positively associated with FFM in both the men and the women after adjustment for stature. This suggests that &lt;strong&gt;wrist breadth&lt;/strong&gt; contributes information regarding the size of the upper appendages that is associated with amounts of fat and lean tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8450591&quot;&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; found that, “The variables which correlated most highly with actual frame size were body mass, &lt;strong&gt;ankle breadth&lt;/strong&gt;, hand length and chest breadth, respectively. These variables were also positively correlated (P &amp;lt; 0.01) with fat-free mass (FFM)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; empirical evidence lending support to Dr. Butt’s predictions based on ankle and wrist measurements.  Incidentally, this matches my own observations.  I’ve been thinking that thick joints were the &lt;a href=&quot;http://complementarytraining.net/interview-with-greg-nuckols/&quot;&gt;best predictor of potential&lt;/a&gt; in powerlifting for a while now, based on my experiences training athletes and meeting a ton of other lifters and meets and seminars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Dr. Butt’s model is &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as good as muscle:bone ratio, but it has the advantage of being &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more user-friendly, and it’s also based on a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of data.  Like muscle:bone ratio, it also has an advantage over FFMI and the Berkhan/Leangains model because it takes frame size into account, instead of just height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do to get a reasonably accurate prediction of your muscular potential is measure your wrist circumference (between your hand and the bony protrusions at the side of your wrist, with your hand open) and your ankle circumference at its smallest point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the calculator below, or check out Dr. Butt’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/bodypred.html&quot;&gt;on his site&lt;/a&gt; if you’d prefer to use pounds and inches instead of centimeters and kilos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that his formulas were based only on men.  However, we can do some back-of-the-napkin math and get a reasonable estimate for women as well.  In Olympic sports, female competitors have about &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cen.12445/abstract&quot;&gt;85% as much lean mass&lt;/a&gt; as their male counterparts, and Francis Holway found that women generally top out at around 4kg of muscle per kilo of bone, versus 5kg for men (20% less muscle relative to their frame size).  Furthermore, since women have more essential fat than men do, they tend to perform the best at around 20% body fat instead of 12%.  So, working with those two assumptions, the calculator above likely still gives women reasonable estimates as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these predictions are by no means perfect (perfectly predicting the end result of a process as multi-factorial as muscle growth based on a handful of simple measurements is, quite frankly, impossible).  Dr. Butt even says that some people will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weightrainer.net/plateau.html&quot;&gt;doing very well to reach 95%&lt;/a&gt; of the maximum predicted by his model, and that it IS possible for a rare freak or two to exceed his predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at this point, it’s the best we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-on-to-strength&quot;&gt;Moving on to strength &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#moving-on-to-strength&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got a pretty decent idea about how much muscle you can build, so it’s time to turn our sights to strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, strength is a product of two factors:  muscle size relative to your height, and mastery of the lifts you’re using to demonstrate your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/complete-strength-training-guide/#section2&quot;&gt;Strength being related to muscle mass is obvious&lt;/a&gt;; the more muscle you have, the more strength potential you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding neural factors, there are a few ways your nervous system can help you lift more.  The most obvious is simply technical mastery of the lifts you’re using to demonstrate strength.  Also, with training, not only does your technique improve, but your nervous system gets better at activating your muscles (both recruiting more motor units, and helping those motor units contract and relax faster for greater total force output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-001-0543-7#page-1&quot;&gt;In elite powerlifters&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a very strong relationship between strength and fat free mass per unit of height.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these lifters, all of whom were competitive at the national or international level, we can assume they’d attained a high degree of mastery for the squat, bench, and deadlift.  The neural component of strength was, if not maxed out, at least comfortably to the point of diminishing returns, so muscle mass was the main thing that determined how much they could lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.53.30.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.57.24.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-23-04.59.47.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
Now, it should be noted that this is data from the 1997 USPF nationals, which allowed bench shirts and squat suits.  However, that’s not a major issue because the gear that existed in the mid-90s didn’t give nearly as large of a performance boost as modern gear does.  The squat and bench would be the only two lifts affected, and, most importantly, the gear used in the ’90s didn’t have a steep learning curve or fundamentally change the lift the way modern gear does; most people would throw on gear for 2-3 weeks before a meet, get a ~10% boost out of it, and go back to training without gear after the meet.  So, for my model, I’m taking that into account by decreasing the slopes of the lines for squat and bench by 10%.
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a really basic calculator based on this data.  The next article will have a few that are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more in-depth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, those are the basics.  Based on frame size, we can get a reasonable estimate of how much muscle you can build, and based on how much muscle you have per unit of height, we can get a reasonable estimate of how much you should be able to lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it take to reach your strength potential? And what do the steps to do so look like? I couldn’t find a complete, accessible overview anywhere, so I decided to make it myself. This article will be the anchor for the website. It’s a comprehensive framework, meant to get you caught up and ready to absorb the rest of the information on this site. Be aware that a more nuts-and-bolts guide is coming (how to actually plan out your sets/reps/exercises) as well.  This guide is just meant to give you an overview of the important factors and principles in play. If you have any questions, if you think something is incomplete or confusing, or if you just plain think I messed something up, don’t hesitate to let me know how I can make this guide better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I’ve been wanting to write for a while, but I’ve been putting it off because, honestly, it’s a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could split it into a series, but I don’t want people to stumble across just the second or third installment and miss the context.  However, be aware up front that it’s probably not one you’ll want to chug through in one sitting. Because of that, you can download it below as a PDF so you can read through it at your leisure, along with spreadsheets laying out multiple example programs showing how you can apply the principles in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will cover what it takes for you to reach your strength potential, and how to do it in the most efficient way possible. It’s not going to dwell on specific topics in a ton of depth; its purpose is to give you an overview of the key factors in your journey from wherever you are now, to your ultimate potential.  Resources addressing more specific topics will be linked, but the purpose of this article is simply to provide you with a comprehensive framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-it-take-to-be-as-strong-as-you-can-be%3F&quot;&gt;What does it take to be as strong as you can be? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-it-take-to-be-as-strong-as-you-can-be%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Big muscles (duh).  For anyone who needs more reassuring, this guide goes into way more depth on this subject later.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mastery of the lifts you’ll be using to demonstrate strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was the strongest athlete of all time?  Anatoly Pisarenko?  Zydrunas Savickas?  Andrey Malanichev? The fact is, there’s not a definitive way to answer that question because they competed in different sports, and strength is defined by the lifts you use to measure it. There is a very large skill component to mastering a lift: You have to get your muscles to work in a very powerful yet precise manner to lift heavy stuff as effectively and efficiently as possible.  This comes with practice – the more specific, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, practice aimed at mastering the lifts you want to use to express your strength is incredibly important. This guide will mainly be talking about the squat, bench press, and deadlift since I’m a powerlifter, and that’s what I know the most about, though these principles are applicable to any strength sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Healthy Joints/Connective tissue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less wear and tear you have on your body, the more you’ll be able to lift, all other things being equal. Your tendons have to be strong enough to transfer force from your muscles to the bones they’re trying to move.  They have a built-in “strain gauge” called the golgi tendon organ that sends a signal to your spinal cord, back to your muscles, telling them to stop contracting as hard, in an effort to prevent a tendon rupture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerves called mechanoreceptors in your ligaments function similarly.  And as you damage or wear away your joint cartilage, it generally heals slowly or not at all (depending on the joint), and once you’ve worn it away, you’re not getting any more.  Over time, this can lead to osteoarthritis. Acute injuries to these tissues generally take a long time to heal (serious ones, at least), and excessive stress to your tendons over time can lead to inflammation (tendonitis), which can progress to degeneration (tendinosis) if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these generally require quite a bit of time to recover from.  What’s more, it’s not uncommon for a soft tissue injury to turn into a long-term headache and impact your training for a long, long time after the initial injury, as collagen generally repairs itself very slowly and often incompletely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, maximizing results while minimizing injury risk is of utmost importance. Worth noting here:  pain and injury don’t always go hand in hand.  That issue is beyond the scope of this guide, but if you’d like to read more, I’d suggest you&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.painscience.com/articles/pain-is-weird.php&quot;&gt; start here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the biopsychosocial model of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three key advantages to being young:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your nervous system is a bit more excitable and works a bit faster, meaning you can reach maximal muscular contraction faster.  This is more important for power-dependent sports (like weightlifting) than maximal force dependent sports (like powerlifting), but it plays a role in all of them.  Also, your nervous system is more plastic when you’re young, meaning you’ll be able to learn and master movements faster (and possibly to a greater absolute degree).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have a bit more of the protein elastin in your tendons, so they’ll be able to store a bit more elastic energy (giving you a more powerful “bounce” out of the hole at the bottom of a squat).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You simply recover from hard training faster.  You have higher testosterone levels, you sleep better and release more total growth hormone at night, and a multitude of other factors that help you be better able to handle high training volumes, recover faster, and progress quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these are tremendously huge factors by themselves, but they all play a role.  They all peak in your late teens, but don’t start dropping off in a big way until your 30s (neural drive) to 50s (tendon elasticity); the exception is neural plasticity, which peaks basically the minute you’re born, and drops steadily from there (which is why it’s easier to learn new things as a child).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can hit your competitive peak by your mid-twenties (some people peak sooner, but generally it takes quite a few years of hard training to build the requisite muscle mass), it helps take advantage of these factors.  This is not to say that you can’t get very, very strong if you start later, but there are advantages to getting to your competitive peak as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-constitutes-appropriate-training%3F&quot;&gt;What constitutes appropriate training? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#what-constitutes-appropriate-training%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an entirely context-dependent question.  There are certain factors that are more or less universal (the training must be specific to your goals, there must be some type of overload applied, etc.), but once you get into the nuts and bolts of program design, there are several factors that determine whether or not a training program will be a good fit for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those factors are specific to the individual.  Their background, strengths and weaknesses, specific leverages, preferences, their current diet, lifestyle, and sleep habits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are some factors that will apply to most individuals in larger groups of people, based on their experience level, assuming their goal is to reach their strength potential (and be as competitive as possible, if that’s your aim) as fast as possible. I want you to keep two things in mind when reading the rest of this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m assuming your primary goal is to get as strong as possible, as fast as possible.  If that doesn’t apply to you, then the rest of what I’m about to say isn’t too relevant for you because it’s not in line with your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BY NO MEANS am I saying this is the only possible way to get strong.  That would be foolhardy.  Simple observation is enough to tell you that there are many roads leading to Rome.  So, if you’re tempted to retort, “so-and-so got so strong and they did it another way,” just know that you’re not going to get any arguments from me.  Also, this means that if you are currently in a certain position and the way you got there differs from the one I recommend, that doesn’t mean you’ve screwed up.  It just means you took a different path to get there, and that’s 100% fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, it’s time to really dive into the meat of this article.  Remember, the four things we need to accomplish to get super strong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastery of the lifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy joints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age/minimizing the time it takes to get there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on your experience level, you can use those four characteristics as your focal points to guide your training.  1 and 2 are where your sweet gainz are made, while 3 and 4 are overarching principles that determine how you train to make those sweet gainz and get from point A (wherever you are now) to point B (the strongest you can possibly be) as fast as possible, as safely as possible. Of course, safety and speed go hand in hand; nothing derails your progress faster than an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each phase of your training will be governed by a simple question: &lt;em&gt;What obstacles standing between me and my end goal are hindering me the most right now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question helps give your training clarity.  Until you’re as strong as you can possibly be, there will always be a multitude of areas where you could seek improvement.  Asking what factors are hindering you the most right now keeps you from chasing 1,000 different goals at once (which gets you nowhere), and helps you make progress at the fastest rate possible by focusing you on winning the biggest battles that give you the highest rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For new lifters, those factors are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy-in/habit formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with the movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Body/muscular awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readiness to train and recover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For intermediate lifters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscular size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to increase your capacity to train and recover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For advanced lifters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proficiency becoming mastery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining joint health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering the skill of competing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-lifter&quot;&gt;The New Lifter &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#the-new-lifter&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;buy-in-and-habit-formation&quot;&gt;Buy-In and Habit Formation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#buy-in-and-habit-formation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most important factors are &lt;strong&gt;buy-in and habit formation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, neither are sexy, exciting topics, but they’re crucially important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to get anywhere as a lifter, you have to be willing to put in the work for years.  A lot of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be thinking: “I’m ready to do it!  I’m excited to see how far I can get in the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most people who start an exercise program end up quitting within the first year, and I’m sure many of them were just as well-intentioned as you are.  It’s unlikely that your initial excitement is going to get you very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we could redirect way off-course and talk about motivation, choice architecture, identity formation, and a bunch of other neat stuff that you probably don’t care to hear about too much in an already-long lifting article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, here are the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to buy into the process.&lt;/strong&gt;  This means actually spending time and money investing in your results early on.  Everyone values their time, and we assign value to things roughly based on what we’re willing to spend on them.  If all you “invest” in lifting is $30/month in gym fees, and 2 hours of your week working out, then if you give it up, you haven’t lost much.  It makes it easier to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been putting in an additional hour per day reading about lifting, and forked over some more cash on books and coaching, then it’ll automatically start mattering more to you.  It’s called the “sunk cost fallacy.”  The more you invest in something, the more you’re convinced that it’s an important thing to have or do, because you’re a rational person after all, and rational people wouldn’t spend so much time/money/energy on something that wasn’t important and didn’t matter to them personally.  Put your mental biases to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to find a community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-person is best (either find someone who’s already a lifter to show you the ropes, or convince a friend or two to start lifting with you), but online communities still beat going it alone.Whichever route you go, the keys are accountability and support. If your training partners don’t hold you accountable if you start skipping a bunch of workouts (or if they’re the lazy ones), then they’re no good for you.  If the people you lift with or the online community you find is permeated by negativity, it’s no good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to enjoy your training.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a key piece most people miss.  Sticking with something is all about the things that make you want to continue outweighing the things that make you want to quit (motivation &amp;gt; obstacles).  Motivations can be intrinsic (coming from inside you) or extrinsic (coming from outside factors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people have some degree of extrinsic motivation when they start lifting (wanting to look better, wanting to lose weight, wanting to feel athletic, etc.), but almost by definition, it’s not very strong.  It wasn’t strong enough to even get your foot in the door until you finally started training, after all.  It’s important, but it’s not what you want to rely on; that’s a big mistake a lot of people make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you can’t rely solely on your extrinsic motivation when you first start lifting, it’s very important that you simply have fun training!  That gives you some more intrinsic motivation (genuinely looking forward to the workouts themselves) to keep you going while lifting becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve noticed, of course, that we usually don’t have any problems finding time to do the things we really like doing, even if we know we probably shouldn’t be doing them (“I should really do something productive, but I’m sure I can watch one more episode.  Damn you, Netflix”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people miss this important fact and get way too hung up on the actual details of programming for new lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re first starting out, you’ll gain muscle and strength doing &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anything; the stimulus is so new, your body is simply going to respond strongly to it, even if it’s not the “optimal” stimulus.  The most important thing is that it’s something you enjoy and can stick with, and that physiologically it’s “good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coaches love to moan about “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/in-defense-of-program-hoppers-dup-revisited/&quot;&gt;program hoppers&lt;/a&gt;,” and they love talking about how new lifters are shooting themselves in the feet by not following masterful training program to the letter.  What they’re missing is the fact that when training new lifters, enjoyment matters just as much as progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If new lifters (with a higher need for extrinsic motivation) don’t enjoy a program, they won’t stick with it, and if they don’t start seeing the results they’re looking for, they’ll get demotivated and quit.  If a coach fails in either of those dimensions (writing programs that work but that people hate, or writing programs that are fun but that don’t get results), they’ve screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual nuts and bolts of how effective-yet-fun programming looks varies person to person.  Some people enjoy more variety (in exercises, set/rep schemes, etc.) and start dreading workouts that look exactly like the rest of the workouts they’ve been doing for the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people love consistency, are wary of change, and enjoy being able to see steady and measurable improvements workout to workout, comparing their performance in one workout to what they did in the same workout yesterday or last week.  A good program for one new lifter may be a terrible program for another, because what constitutes enjoyable training varies person to person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-proficiency&quot;&gt;Developing Proficiency &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#developing-proficiency&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on, the second most important factor is &lt;strong&gt;developing proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; with the movements you’re using to express your strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you learn a new motor pattern?  Practice.  Specifically, frequent, purposeful practice.  The more times you do something, and do it the way you’re supposed to, the faster your nervous system will master and store the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The practice must be deep and purposeful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t simply go through the motions.  Practice starts before the set.  Visualize how the set is supposed to look and feel, trying to capture as many details as possible: how the bar will feel on your back or in your hands, how you’ll set up, how it will feel to move the load, etc.  Initially you may not be able to capture too much in your visualization, but this is a skill that will improve over time. As you approach the bar, have one cue in mind.  Don’t try to “think your way through the rep.”  Just focus on one thing that will help your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it improves your performance, stick with that cue until you master it and can move on to another.  If it doesn’t choose another cue.  Be aware of how the reps feel as you’re doing them, but don’t obsess about it; use that awareness in the next step.  After the set, analyze it.  How did it feel?  How did it look (again, take video if possible)?  What could be improved upon, and what cue could help you accomplish that improvement? Repeat that process for each set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply doing the movements helps, but to gain proficiency with the lifts as quickly as possible, practice needs to be deep and purposeful to cement the skills and keep bad habits from developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The weights you’re using should be light enough&lt;/strong&gt; that you’re in control of the load and can focus more on properly performing the movement than on avoiding death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the weights should also be heavy enough that it’s still the same basic movement (a heavy barbell squat is pretty dissimilar to an unloaded bodyweight squat). This generally means using a load between 60-80% of your 1rm.  Of course, if you’re a new lifter, you have no idea what your 1rm is.  So the basic rule of thumb is that you should use something between the heaviest weight that you feel very comfortable and confident with, and about 15% less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should stay a long way away from failure on your sets, at least early on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more you have to strain to complete a rep, the more your form will break down, at least until you’ve gained proficiency with the motor pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re doing sets of 5, and the first three are beautiful, flawless reps, the fourth is a little shaky, and the fifth looks distinctly different from the first three.  You’re ingraining the proper motor pattern you want to learn with 60% of your work, and something else with the other 40%.  That makes it take longer to gain proficiency with the proper technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should stay at least 3 reps away from failure (to complete a lift) as a new lifter, and almost always stop your sets before (or, if you push a rep too far, as soon as) your form starts to change at all.  At first, you won’t be entirely sure what that feels like, so it helps to either have training partners watch your technique, or record your sets (with the camera set up directly to your side between knee and hip height for squat, at hip height for DL, and 6-8 above bench height for bench) so you can compare how the lifts felt to how they looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will teach you what it feels like to complete reps with good form, what hard-but-flawless reps feel like (often a lift will feel like you screwed something up, but look great on video), and what messed-up ones feel like.  To get in enough work while avoiding failure and technical breakdown, multiple sets of low reps are your best bet.  The fewer reps you do each set, the less fatigue you’ll develop from your first rep to your last rep, and the shorter the time you need to be locked in and focused on your technique will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally, training each lift 2-4 times per week will give you the best bang for your buck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  Two reasons:  1.) You need enough opportunities to practice the movements.  Practice is key for learning anything new.  2.) You can simply do more! You’d have to really crush yourself to get in as much work on a lift in one day as you could in three fairly challenging days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why cap it at 4?  Quite frankly, for a new lifter, you’re probably not going to benefit from doing much more than that.  You could practice the movements a &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt; more frequently, but probably not enough to make a tremendous difference. More importantly, muscle protein synthesis stays elevated for new lifters for quite a long time: 36-48 hours is pretty typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more experienced lifters, that’s down to 12-24 hours (or less, depending on how hard the workout is).  So with 2-4 sessions per lift, per week, you’re still spending quite a bit of time actually building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next key factor is developing muscular and kinesthetic awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinesthetic awareness is just a fancy way of saying “knowing where your body is in space.”  Developing this ability helps you do two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better understand when the movements you’re doing “feel” right or not.  This feedback helps you make adjustments to perform the movements better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help external cues work better.  External cues are those that focus on the outcome of the movement (i.e. for bench, you may say “throw the bar through the ceiling,” rather than “squeeze your pecs”), and are&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/2013/04/17/external-cues/&quot;&gt; generally more effective for enhancing performance&lt;/a&gt;.  The better you understand how it feels for your body to move through space, the more sense external cues will make, the better you’ll be able to apply them, and the more they’ll help your performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to accomplish this?  I’ve found challenging bodyweight movements to be the most effective in teaching overall body awareness.  Do I have a citation for that?  Absolutely not, because that would be damn near impossible to test.  But of all the people I’ve worked with, those with backgrounds in gymnastics and martial arts almost always learn new movements faster than anyone else, and “get” new external cues the quickest.  I’ve also found that “weird” lifts help build this type of awareness too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions of bodyweight movements that can help (start with the ones you can do): push-ups (working toward single arm pushups), dips, inverted rows, pull-ups, monkey bars, planks, rolling of all sorts, single leg RDLs (weighted or unweighted), lunges and split squats (at a speed you can control), single leg balance drills, single leg hops, L-sits, suitcase carries, waiter’s carries, single arm overhead press, bent press, and single arm overhead squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly many more that you could try, but choosing 2-3 from that list per session, done for 2 sets of as many reps as you can manage at a controlled pace (not rushing through the motions) generally does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not saying that you’ll directly make sweet gainz from those exercises unless you load them up and train them more like the barbell lifts, but they help you develop the kinesthetic awareness that will allow you to learn new movements better (attaining a higher end degree of proficiency) and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that this type of training usually doesn’t do as much for someone with a strong background in sports (especially if you are pretty good at them, and have played recently), because sports training usually helps you develop kinesthetic awareness.  The people who usually benefit the most from it are folks who haven’t played any sports in a long time (or ever) and haven’t been challenging their kinesthetic abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;muscular-awareness&quot;&gt;Muscular Awareness &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscular-awareness&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next piece is muscular awareness.  I hate the phrase “mind muscle connection,” but it’s a common expression that gets the point across.  Building this awareness accomplishes two major things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It helps you identify your weak link in a movement if a particular muscle group isn’t “pulling its weight.”&lt;/strong&gt; If you don’t know how it feels when a particular muscle contracts, it’s hard to pick it out as the culprit when a lift doesn’t feel right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It makes internal cues more effective.&lt;/strong&gt;  Internal cues are ones that refer to what a particular part of your body is doing during a lift (i.e. “squeeze your pecs,” not “throw the bar through the ceiling”). Though internal cues are generally less effective than external cues, they still have their place, especially if you’re working on correcting a weak link in a movement, and you’re trying to re-integrate a muscle group into a movement pattern where it hasn’t been pulling its weight.  If a muscle has been weak and limiting a movement, your body learns how to get more out of other muscles to compensate.  When that weak muscle gets stronger, focusing on it can help get it more involved in the lift again and fine tune that motor pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you accomplish this?  “Bodybuilding”-style isolation movements.  The tool is relatively unimportant.  Barbells, dumbbells, machines, and cables are all totally fine.  The goal isn’t to move the most weight, but rather to feel the target muscle contracting to build that muscular awareness (or “mind muscle connection,” if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the movements to build kinesthetic awareness, the goal isn’t necessarily boatloads of sweet gainz (since compound exercises like squats, presses, deadlifts, rows, pull-ups, etc.,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2015-0109#.VWox1Is-A0o&quot;&gt; do just as good of a job at building muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://asjsm.com/24057.fulltext&quot;&gt; especially in new lifters&lt;/a&gt;), but rather to make it easier to learn the lifts you’re trying to build proficiency in, and to make it easier to assess problems and correct your lifts down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-hard-and-recover&quot;&gt;Train Hard and Recover &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#train-hard-and-recover&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last key factor for new lifters is developing the ability to train hard and recover from training.  This is often termed GPP (general physical preparedness), but most people only think of conditioning when they think of GPP.  Though that’s important, there are a few other factors, so I prefer the more encompassing term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/increasing-work-capacity/&quot;&gt;work capacity&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body composition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high body fat percentage&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/being-strong-is-not-an-excuse-to-be-fat-and-being-fat-is-probably-holding-you-back/&quot;&gt; generally goes hand in hand with poor insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and for every pound of tissue gained, a&lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06482.x/abstract&quot;&gt; smaller percentage of it will be muscle, and a greater percentage of it will be fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for that.  Higher body fat levels are generally accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4154787/&quot;&gt;lower testosterone and higher estrogen levels in men&lt;/a&gt; (since fat tissue contains the enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. It should also be noted that the causality here is bidirectional; with low testosterone, it’s easier to gain fat, and more fat further lowers testosterone); lower insulin sensitivity, especially in muscle, will mean more of the energy you consume is stored in fat tissue, and there’s mounting evidence that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25695947&quot;&gt; can decrease anabolic (muscle-building) signaling and increase catabolic (muscle wasting) signaling in your muscles&lt;/a&gt; (and a&lt;a href=&quot;http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3290&amp;amp;context=etd&quot;&gt; second source&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, you’ll respond better to training and recover better from training if you’re leaner.  If you’re a male over 20% bodyfat, or a female over 30% body fat, getting down to the 12-15%/20-25% range will make it easier to train hard, recover well, and build more muscle and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerobic conditioning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve already written a pretty in-depth piece on the importance of aerobic conditioning for strength athletes, so rather than rehash that here, I’d encourage you to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/avoiding-cardio-could-be-holding-you-back/&quot;&gt; check it out&lt;/a&gt;. The degree to which you need to do any dedicated conditioning work varies person to person (some people just naturally have higher aerobic fitness), but a general rule of thumb is that if your resting heart rate is in the high 50s or low 60s and you’re under 200lbs, or it’s in the mid 60s and you’re over 200lbs, you probably have a sufficient aerobic base for powerlifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a topic that is impossible to address in a single paragraph.  I’d highly suggest the book “&lt;a href=&quot;https://renaissanceperiodization.com/shop/the-renaissance-diet/&quot;&gt;The Renaissance Diet&lt;/a&gt;” by my friend Dr. Mike Israetel for an in-depth treatment of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle factors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This primarily means sleep and stress management.  Lack of sleep and increased stress decrease how well you can burn fat, build muscle, and recover from training.  I’ll address this is much more depth at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you work toward the goal of being able to train harder and recover better depends largely on where you’re at right now.  If you’re portly, then you should try to lose fat ASAP, whereas if you’re already lean, you shouldn’t try to lose any weight.  If your nutrition is in line, but your baseline conditioning is poor, then you should work on improving your conditioning.  If your conditioning is good but your sleep habits are atrocious, then you’d benefit most from getting more high quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of reassurance if you’re overweight to start with:  You really don’t need to worry about how losing weight will impact your initial strength/muscular progress.  Though new muscle is most easily added in a caloric surplus, it’s entirely possible to gain muscle and strength while losing fat.  This is especially true for people who are both new to lifting and overweight to begin with.  If you set your calories to lose about 1% of your bodyweight per week, consume enough protein (about .82g/lb, or 1.8g/kg), and train hard, then you should have no issues gaining muscle and strength as you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-long-does-this-phase-last%3F&quot;&gt;How Long Does This Phase Last? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#how-long-does-this-phase-last%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major mistake new lifters make is sticking with beginner programs for too long.  Your two most important objectives are to buy into the process and make training a habit, and to become proficient with the movements.  The third objective (building kinesthetic and muscular awareness) helps with the second objective, and the fourth (ability to train hard and recover well) sets the stage for future training to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve gained proficiency with the lifts, there’s no point in dilly dallying with beginner programs any more.  A lot of people will run a beginner’s program entirely too long until they plateau multiple times and wind up frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the strength gains you make on a beginner’s program come from neurological improvements – your nervous system learning the lifts you’re performing.  When you first start lifting, you may have enough muscle to squat 300lbs already, but you can only squat 135 because your nervous system doesn’t “understand” the lift yet; you haven’t built that proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the span of a few months, you should be able to add weight to the bar at least weekly, and your squat may skyrocket into the 300s.  Your muscle mass may have only increased by 10-20%, but your squat went up to a much greater degree because your nervous system adapts to stressors much faster than your muscles do.  When you hit a wall and your lifts stop going up as quickly, it’s because you’re finally bumping up against the limits of how much you can lift with your current muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue getting stronger, you have to gain more muscle.  And simply put, a beginner training routine optimized for learning the lifts isn’t optimized for gaining a ton of muscle mass.  Hypertrophy training generally involves training with accumulated fatigue because the main driver of muscle growth is&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#3&quot;&gt; training volume&lt;/a&gt;, but movements are best learned when your muscles and nervous system are both fairly fresh (another reason volume per session shouldn’t be too high, and sets of your main lifts shouldn’t be pushed close to failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id=&quot;attachment_43290&quot; aria-describedby=&quot;caption-attachment-43290&quot; style=&quot;width: 157px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![New Lifter&#39;s Guide](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kv9KLMY-475x1024.png)](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kv9KLMY.png)
&lt;figcaption id=&quot;caption-attachment-43290&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Click to expand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you hit a wall for the first time on a beginner’s program, it’s time to shift training styles.  Otherwise, you can only continue to get stronger as you gain muscle, and you’re stuck with a training routine that’s adequate for gaining muscle, but not optimized for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how long should you be on a beginner’s routine before shifting to an intermediate routine?  It depends on the person.  Simply stick with it until you’re having a hard time adding weight week to week without grinding reps.  That lets you know that the easy strength progress you get from gaining proficiency with the lifts is about to run out, so it’s time for a change.  In general, this may take you anywhere from 2-6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it can happen for different lifts at different times.  Is your bench progress slowing, while your squat and deadlift are still shooting up?  Then change your bench training, but keep training your squat and deadlift the same way until they too are topped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re out of low-hanging fruit. You’ve gained proficiency with the lifts, so the easy neurological gains are in your rearview mirror.  Now it’s time to grow. You have two primary goals in this phase of training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue increasing your work capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll address these in reverse order.  Everything that applied to the subject of being able to train hard and recover well from the previous section still applies here.  If you’re not lean yet, keep cutting.  If your conditioning is still lacking, keep improving it.  If your sleep and diet are still poor and your stress is still high, then keep working on addressing those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing your work capacity is of utmost importance because, as previously mentioned, training volume is the #1 driver of hypertrophy.  You’ve got to handle high training volume to grow, so you need to be able to recover from that training volume.  On top of appropriate nutrition, adequate sleep, low stress, and favorable body composition, simply increasing your training volume over time will help build that work capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to talk about getting jacked.  Before addressing exactly HOW to get jacked, though, I first need to touch on WHY training to gain muscle mass is so important for strength athletes, since I always get a surprising amount of pushback about this idea. If you’re already on board with the importance of gaining as much muscle as you possibly can, feel free to jump to the section titled “implementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-some-people-lift-more-and-others-lift-less&quot;&gt;Why some people lift more and others lift less &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#why-some-people-lift-more-and-others-lift-less&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, by my count, six factors that largely determine how much weight you can lift right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle fiber types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segment lengths (height, limb lengths, torso length, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motor learning factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivation/arousal/fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle origins and insertions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-size&quot;&gt;Muscle Size &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-size&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bigger muscle, all other things being equal (and those “other things” are the rest of this section), is a stronger muscle. There’s no way around it; past a point, you simply have to grow. I won’t harp on this one too much more, as I’ll be talking about it in more detail later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-fiber-types&quot;&gt;Muscle Fiber Types &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-fiber-types&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get this one out of the way early, because it’s often misunderstood. Most people are under the assumption that you’ll lift more if you have a greater proportion of type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers. However, that belief is based on a misunderstanding of terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type I muscle fibers and Type II muscle fibers differ in several major ways. Type I muscle fibers are less fatiguable (making them great for endurance exercise) and take longer to reach maximal force when stimulated. Type II fibers, on the other hand, are more fatiguable but can reach maximal force much faster when stimulated (making them great for power-dependent exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the maximal force production for a given area of Type I fibers is very similar to the maximal force production for a given area of Type II fibers.  Depending on what study or textbook you look at, there may be up to a 10% difference.  However, this difference doesn’t mean much in the real world since all your muscles have a mix of Type I and Type II fibers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compared someone with 70% Type II fibers to someone with 70% type I fibers (both of whom would be outliers), the difference in maximal force production would only be about 4%. Type II fibers simply reach maximal force output sooner, making them better for &lt;em&gt;power-dependent&lt;/em&gt; activities like sprinting or jumping. Powerlifting, though (contrary to what the name may lead you to believe), is NOT a power-dependent sport. Power output actually peaks around 30-60%1rm and is quite low with maximal loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which means, fiber type distribution doesn’t influence how much you can lift very much at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type II fibers are more responsive to strength training and grow more than Type I fibers do, so fiber type distribution &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; limit long-term strength potential &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt;. However, that’s purely theoretical, because research has shown that elite powerlifters (average squat/deadlift of about 285kg/630lbs, and bench 170kg/375lbs) actually have about the same&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luzimarteixeira.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/tipo-de-fibra03.pdf&quot;&gt; Type I/Type II fiber ratio as untrained people&lt;/a&gt;, which leads you to believe the sport itself didn’t select for people with a fiber ratio skewed toward Type II. So it may be a concern for someone with an unusually high proportion of Type I fibers, but it won’t be for the vast majority of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Type II fibers reach peak force output faster than Type I fibers, there’s a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; chance that they’ll allow for more speed to be developed off the chest on bench, out of the hole on squat, or off the floor on deadlift, and that speed may help you get max weights through the sticking point of the lift more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that’s a bit of a stretch for both squat and bench because the muscles are already contracting quite hard to control the weight while lowering it; for max loads, all your slow twitch fibers are probably recruited already (since they’re the ones recruited first –&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henneman&#39;s_size_principle&quot;&gt;Henneman’s Size Principle&lt;/a&gt;) before you reverse the weight, so regardless of fiber type breakdown, the additional fibers activated as you reverse the lifts are primarily fast twitch anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 437px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignright&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fiber-Types-Powerlifters-Fry-2003.png)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Similar proportions of Type I and Type II (IIa and IIb combined) fibers in pretty strong powerlifters and untrained controls. From Fry et. Al, 2003.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for deadlift, most people are weakest off the floor.  Taking longer to reach maximal force output would mainly just affect how long it took for the bar to break the floor, not the speed of the lift itself.  For someone who is weaker in another part of the movement, being able to develop more speed earlier in the movement may give a small advantage, but not enough to be a tremendously important issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I’m only saying fiber type distribution is largely unimportant for powerlifting. For other sports, it certainly matters. More Type I fibers are beneficial for endurance events, and more Type II fibers are beneficial for power-dependent sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;segment-lengths&quot;&gt;Segment Lengths &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#segment-lengths&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been talking about how much &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; a muscle can contract with. Now we’re talking about the &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; required to produce movement at a joint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torque takes into account both the force applied and the length of the lever (or moment arm) it’s applied against. Basic application: If you’re sitting on a seesaw and someone much larger is sitting across from you, if you’re both sitting at the end of your respective sides, the other person will be sitting on the ground, and you’ll be way up in the air. If they move closer to the middle (the fulcrum), it can balance out the seesaw, even though they’re larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 329px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/see-saw-fat-guy.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;This guy would have to be sitting basically right on top of the fulcrum.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s say two people are squatting, and everything is the same about them (same basic technique, same level of training, same amount of muscle mass, etc.) except that one of them has longer femurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that either the moment arm the quads are working against to extend the knees (the distance between the knee and the center of mass – roughly mid-foot), the moment arm the glutes/adductors/hamstrings are working against to extend the hip, or both will be longer for the person with longer femurs. That means that his muscles will have to contract harder (produce more force) to produce the required torque to squat a given weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femur and torso length affect both squats and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/everything-you-think-is-wrong-with-your-deadlift/&quot;&gt; deadlifts&lt;/a&gt; in this manner. Additionally, total height factors in; since the length of basically all segments will be longer, it requires more muscular force to produce the requisite torque to lift any given load. Finally, arm length is important for both deadlift (shortens the ROM, making the lift easier) and bench press (increases the total ROM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, taken as a whole, segment lengths really don’t matter too much for OVERALL powerlifting performance. For starters, you’re probably not as special of a snowflake as you think you are. Although there is some variability in relative segment lengths, it’s usually less than 10% except for extreme outliers (so that guy who squats twice as much as you doesn’t do so because you have long femurs. If yours were the same length, he may squat 1.8x as much as you instead of 2x as much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as height goes, required torque increases with height, but so does overall muscle mass.  The scaling is allometric, not linear, so shorter people still have a bit of an advantage, but it’s taken into account with the&lt;a href=&quot;http://wilkscalculator.com/&quot;&gt; Wilks formula&lt;/a&gt;, which levels the playing field for shorter/lighter lifters and taller/heavier lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the advantage that different segment lengths provide in one lift is abolished by a disadvantage in another. Long femurs may be bad for squatting, but they’re usually good for deadlifting (since long arms and legs tend to go hand in hand). Long arms may be good for deadlifting, but they’re usually bad for benching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, segment lengths do affect performance in each lift a bit, but not as much as people who use them as a crutch would like to believe (usually a difference of less than 10%). Furthermore, a disadvantage in one lift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;muscle-origins-and-insertions&quot;&gt;Muscle Origins and Insertions &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#muscle-origins-and-insertions&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge factor not many people talk about. Our bodies aren’t actually built very well for lifting heavy things. When you compare humans to comparably sized animals, we tend to be far weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reason for that is difference in muscle attachments. A muscle that attaches further from a joint is capable of producing more torque at that joint. Our muscles, for the most part, attach very close to the joints they move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 328px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Torque-Wrench.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Grab at point B if you want to actually get the job done. Grab at point A if you’re trying to get a sick forearm pump.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good for allowing large ranges of motion (because a given amount of movement at a joint requires less tissue extensibility), but means that the force (linear) our muscles produce isn’t translated very efficiently into torque (angular) at our joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple illustration. If you grip this wrench at point A, you’ll have to pull a lot harder to turn the bolt than if you were gripping it at point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, humans’ muscles attach in a manner more similar to point A, and other animals’ attach in a manner more similar to point B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you’ll see what I’m talking about, let’s compare the hamstrings of a human and a cat. Look how far down the tibia and fibula the hamstring muscles (marked 17 and 18) of a cat insert, compared to how close to the knee human hamstrings insert. That means that if a human and a cat contract their hamstrings with the same amount of force, the cat will produce WAY more knee flexion torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 770px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Cat-Muscles.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Efficient hamstrings insertions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 640px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hamstrings.gif)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Inefficient insertions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have some variability in muscle attachment points, and this variability matters far more than variability in segment lengths, because a small change can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to illustrate: Let’s say you’re comparing hip extension torque for two people doing good mornings with their torsos parallel to the ground. One person’s torso is 10% longer than the other person’s. That means the moment arm (basically the front-to-back distance from the barbell to their hip joint) is 10% longer for the person with a longer torso, so they need to produce 10% more hip extension torque to lift a given load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you’re comparing two people with the same torso length, but one person’s ischial tuberosity (the origin point for the hamstrings) protrudes an extra inch, or their hamstrings originate a bit further down on the ischial tuberosity – which is entirely within the realm of possibility.  Pelvises come in all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pelves.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Responsive image&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the distance between the hip joint and the origin of the hamstrings is about 3 inches on average. That extra inch means they produce ~33% more hip extension torque if their hamstrings contract with the same force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because muscles attach so close to joints (usually not more than 2-4 inches away), small variations can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your pecs insert farther down your humerus, you’re more apt to be a big bencher. If your lats insert farther down your humerus, you’re more apt to be able to do some really heavy weighted pullups. If your patellar tendon inserts a bit farther down your tibia, you’ll probably be able to squat more. You know that guy who can curl a ton without impressive biceps? I’d bet he has biceps that insert farther down his radius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-what-do-we-do-with-all-this%3F&quot;&gt;So what do we do with all this? &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-do-we-do-with-all-this%3F&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take a look back at each of these factors to see where we should direct our efforts in training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origins and insertions&lt;/em&gt;: This may impact what technique will allow you to lift the most weight (another reason why the notion of universal “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2014/09/28/myth-perfect-form/&quot;&gt;perfect form&lt;/a&gt;” is laughable), but you can’t really change them, barring surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motivation/arousal/fatigue&lt;/em&gt;: These are all acute factors. Learning how to mitigate fatigue and manage arousal are good skills to acquire, but they have more to do with how much you can lift &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; rather than long-term strength potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motor learning/neuromuscular efficiency&lt;/em&gt;: Proficiency/mastery comes with practice.  The incremental gains in neuromuscular efficiency that come with continued practice after the initial improvements when you start lifting aren’t enough to explain the size of the strength differences between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Segment lengths&lt;/em&gt;: Similar to muscle origins and insertions, these may affect technique to a certain degree, but you’ve got to play the hand you’re dealt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muscle fiber types&lt;/em&gt;: Ditto. Plus, they don’t really matter too much for powerlifting anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Muscle size&lt;/em&gt;: Ding ding ding. We have our winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the factors we’ve discussed, muscle size is the only one you’re able to change in a major way in the long run, except for motor learning/neuromuscular efficiency (however, the differences between people in this area are pretty small after the initial rapid progress when you start lifting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I’d just like to point out that training with a focus on gaining mass to dominate at powerlifting is directly supported in the literature.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11990746&quot;&gt; One study&lt;/a&gt; found that in elite level powerlifters, performance in all three lifts was strongly correlated (r=0.8-0.9 for some) to muscle thickness in the prime movers (although bizarrely, it was most strongly correlated to subscapularis thickness in all three lifts, just as an aside).&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25611080&quot;&gt; Another&lt;/a&gt;, hot off the presses, found again that one of the strongest predictors of performance in national-level lifters was muscle mass per unit height. Big is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 960px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-School-Powerlifters.jpg)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Some of the top guys in the world today, looking suspiciously swole.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of direct quotes: Brechue and Abe. “The Role of FFM Accumulation and Muscle Architecture in Powerlifting Performance.”  European Journal of Applied Physiology.  (2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance of the SQT, BP, and DL was strongly correlated with FFM and FFM relative to standing height (r = 0.86 to 0.95, P &amp;lt; or = 0.001).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovera and Keogh. “The Anthropometric Profile of Powerlifters: Differences as a Function of Bodyweight Class and Competitive Success.” The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness. (2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…more successful powerlifters typically have higher degrees of muscle mass expressed per unit height and/or bone mass but similar segment lengths and segment length ratios to their less successful peers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to reiterate, both studies found that the key issue was muscle mass &lt;em&gt;per unit of height&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that, since you can’t make yourself any taller or shorter, simply gaining more muscle is almost always an advantage. Think of muscle mass as &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; strength. If you gain mass, you may not necessarily be stronger right away (i.e. if you trained with lower weights and lost a bit of technical efficiency with max weights), but you have the potential to be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you stay the same size, you have a cap on how strong you can possibly get. When comparing two individuals, the one with more muscle may not necessarily be the stronger one (for all the factors listed above – muscle attachments, segment lengths, technique, etc.), though he probably will be. However, when comparing small you to jacked you, all other things being equal, jacked you will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those other factors (apart from muscle size), particularly segment lengths and muscle attachment points, largely explain why some relatively light people who aren’t overly jacked-looking can still lift huge weights.  It’s not that their smaller muscles contract any harder than yours do; it’s that either they have body segment lengths that are advantageous for a certain lift, requiring less torque to lift a given weight, or they have muscle attachment points that allow them to produce more torque at a joint with the same force of muscle contraction.  There wasn’t any special training that allowed them to lift heavy weights with relatively little mass; most of it simply has to do with how they’re built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the primary goal of intermediate training is to get into the highest weight class possible, as fast as possible, while still being fairly lean (below 15% body fat for men, and below 25% for women) and protecting the joints as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people balk at the idea of moving into higher weight classes, because people lift more in higher weight classes, so they think it will benefit them to get into a lower weight class. However, remember the bit about levers and torque.  If you are taller than someone else, you have to produce more muscular &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; to generate sufficient &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; to lift the same amount of weight.  Being taller than other people in your weight class automatically puts you at a disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if you can get super jacked and be one of the shortest people in your weight class (while staying fairly lean), it puts you at an advantage.  Though you may be more competitive &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; in a lower weight class, it’s probably not where you’ll be most competitive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of my weightlifting friends are fond of saying: “Weight classes are height classes in disguise.” Of course, if you don’t plan on competing and are just trying to get strong for its own sake, it should be obvious that gaining as much muscle as possible is a definite advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#implementation&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you have three primary goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get freaking jacked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulate the least amount of joint wear and tear possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain or increase proficiency with the lifts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a general outline for how to accomplish that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ramp up your training intensity for the main lifts a bit (doing most of your training with 75-85% of your max, with very little work below 70% and very little above 90% unless peaking for a meet) to continue improving your technique and skill lifting heavy weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include more variation for your main lifts.  This will allow you to push your lifts hard, while avoiding monotony and overuse injuries from sticking with the exact same movements all the time.  Paused squat, front squat, close grip bench, bench from pins, opposite stance deadlifts, deficit deadlifts, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep volume for your main lifts low to moderate, and stay at least 1-2 reps shy of failure at all times (avoiding technical failure).  You don’t need a ton of high quality, heavy work to maintain and improve neural factors, but getting the bulk of your training volume from your main lifts will generally beat you up a bit more, and limit how much total training volume you can handle per session and per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the bulk of your training volume from accessory lifts for all major muscle groups, with sets of 6-15 reps, training each muscle/movement 2-3 times per week for&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20300012&quot;&gt; 4-6 sets&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326698&quot;&gt;or 40-70 total reps&lt;/a&gt;) per session.  I recommend accessory lifts over lighter sets of squat, bench, and deadlift to cut down on risk of overuse injuries, and to keep training specificity high for the main lifts (since lifting heavy stuff for low reps and lighter stuff for higher reps are different skills, you don’t want to “water down” the motor learning you’re doing your main lifts, unless you’re splitting your training into more distinct phases, as we’ll discuss later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan for weight increases and PR attempts for the big lifts on a realistic time scale.  At first, use 4 week training blocks, shooting for small PRs every 4 weeks.  When you aren’t hitting PRs consistently on that time scale any more, transition to 8 week cycles, then 12.  You should be able to PR every 12 weeks (during bulk phases) throughout the duration of your time doing intermediate, hypertrophy-focused training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodization&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strengthandconditioningresearch.com/hypertrophy/#11&quot;&gt; isn’t overly important for hypertrophy&lt;/a&gt;, but varying your training a bit simply helps keep workouts feeling fresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split your training into bulking and cutting phases.  This generally allows you to gain muscle at a faster overall rate than attempting to gain it with minimal body fat fluctuations.  Aim to gain about half a pound per week until your body fat percentage reaches about 20-22% for men, and 28-30% for women, then slowly cut back down to 10-15% for men, and 20-25% for women, losing about 1% of your bodyweight per week.  I’d highly recommend&lt;a href=&quot;http://rippedbody.jp/how-to-bulk/&quot;&gt; this article&lt;/a&gt; for more in-depth details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t tie up too much of your time in training to peak for competitions.  A simple 3-4 week peak will be enough for most people to hit very solid lifts on the platform since you’re training the main lifts fairly heavy throughout this period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 480px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screenshot-2015-06-02-13.46.551.png)](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.strengthandconditioningresearch.com%2F2014%2F07%2F08%2Finjury-strength-sports%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHU0gKH0B1rhzIkx-cpyYjXxbKWvw)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;From strengthandconditioningresearch.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the reasons given above, a major reason to make your training more “bodybuilding-centric” during this phase is that bodybuilding-style training has an astoundingly low injury rate.  When looking at injury rates in various strength sports, bodybuilding generally fares considerably better than powerlifting, weightlifting, or strongman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 200px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Journey-Intermediate1.png)](http://i.imgur.com/mgyuxC6.png)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Click to expand graphic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the importance of maintaining joint health over the long haul.  Yes, you can absolutely build a ton of muscle doing more heavy powerlifting-specific training&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-new-approach-to-training-volume/&quot;&gt; as long as you’re doing enough sets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the goal for this phase is to build that muscle while minimizing risk to set you up for greater long-term success, and even the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714538&quot;&gt; best study to date&lt;/a&gt; comparing volume-equated “powerlifting-style” vs. “bodybuilding-style” training found that, while they produced similar hypertrophy, getting that volume from heavier training caused more aches and general feelings of being worn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does this usually last?  Again, it depends on the person and how quickly they gain muscle (which is largely genetic).  It’s generally a period of 3-8 years.  The first time you gain less than 3-5 pounds of muscle (comparing at similar body fat percentages) in a year of consistent training and diet, it’s time to transition to advanced training and start wrecking worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advanced-training&quot;&gt;Advanced Training &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;#advanced-training&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you have most of the muscle you’re ever going to get (unless you’ve been drug-free to this point and decide to start taking vitamin S), so your job is to get everything you can out of it. That requires moving from proficiency to mastery with the lifts. Though by this point, you’ve already taken care of the low-hanging fruit in terms of neuromuscular improvements, there’s still room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s actually a surprising amount of neural coordination that goes into lifting really heavy stuff.  You have to activate the vast majority of the muscle fibers in your prime movers, you have to coordinate their contractions so that the sequencing of the lift is perfect (both intermuscular and intramuscular coordination), and then those muscle fibers have you contract and relax very rapidly (rate coding), and the more rapidly they can do so, the more force the muscle can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating the muscle fibers and coordinating the movement can both be learned with submaximal weights (about 80-85% of your max works nicely). However, there are slight changes in technique that take place with maximal loads (not form breakdown – the extra weight just changes how force is distributed throughout the system slightly), meaning the general coordination can be honed even further.  Additionally, rate coding (the speed at which the fibers can contract and relax) doesn’t start accounting for increases in muscular force until the muscle is already contracting at about 80-85% of its maximal force, meaning that it is also best trained with even heavier loads, and can still be improved upon once you reach the advanced level. Periodization also plays a larger role in advanced, purely strength-focused training, as it&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15673040&quot;&gt; contributes more to strength development&lt;/a&gt; than muscle hypertrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a general outline of how advanced training should be set up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The offseason period is dedicated to building specific work capacity for the main lifts, meaning lots of submaximal training utilizing variants of the main lifts (high frequency, high volume, relatively low intensity, and high variation to decrease risk of overuse injuries).  This prepares your body to handle the very heavy loading necessary to drive mastery of the lifts with maximal weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the offseason, accessory work should be dedicated primarily toward fixing specific muscular weaknesses that are hindering performance in your main lifts.  Cut back on the amount of other “bodybuilding” work you do so more of your energy can be devoted to the main lifts.  It’s hard to mix high volumes of squat, bench press, and deadlift with equally high volumes of accessory lifts, making the latter a poor use of time and energy since you’re simply not going to achieve much extra hypertrophy from them anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you approach a meet, decrease training frequency and volume for each lift so you can increase intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the last ~6 weeks before a meet, be very conservative with accessory work.  That’s not enough time to add much extra muscle, and the more energy you use on accessories, the less you have to devote to your main lifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to maximize the number of high quality lifts you can get in with 85-95% of your 1rm while minimizing fatigue for the last 4-6 weeks before a meet.  You want to be as fresh as possible for each heavy session so your high output work can be as close to maximal output as possible (very high specificity necessary for mastery).  Your goal is to practice the lifts as much as possible in a hyper-specific manner, which necessitates very high loads and very low fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to compete about twice per year.  You want enough time between meets that you can reasonably improve your total each time you step on the platform, but you also want to practice competing so that you get practice managing meet-day nerves, picking attempts, cutting weight, etc.  You can certainly compete before reaching the advanced level, but this is when the skill of competing matters the most.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 200px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;[![](https://myzone-strengtheory.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The-Journey-Advanced.png)](http://i.imgur.com/njQ7TPS.png)
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Click to expand graphic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long can you continue improving once you’ve reached this level?  As with each of the other phases, it depends. There’s no reason you can’t keep improving until injuries start to set in, or until the aging process finally catches up with you.  You’ll never reach 100% technical perfection, so there’s always some room to improve there. You’ll also be able to continue gaining a little muscle each year.  Not a ton, but enough to make a small difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to point out something I didn’t state explicitly.  Beginner, intermediate, and advanced are defined in this guide by the primary factors limiting performance, NOT arbitrary strength standards.  How much you can lift at the end of each of these phases is mostly dependent on how well you chose your parents (the genetic hand you were dealt).  This isn’t a guide for breaking world records.  It’s a guide for reaching your own strength potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide has focused primarily on training.  However, I want to reiterate that training doesn’t take place in a vacuum.  Proper nutrition, sufficient sleep, and stress management all play just as big of a role as proper training, if not bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t get stronger in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t stop to consider this basic fact. At the end of a workout, you’ve accumulated some fatigue and you’re weaker than when you walked into the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get stronger outside the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we do with this information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should make you look at training from a slightly different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than looking at training with the perspective of “I’m going to do this because it will make me bigger and stronger,” you should look at training thinking, “I’m sending my body a message, and I would like it to respond to that message by strengthening and growing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a semantic difference, but it’s an important one, because it helps put the entire training process in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it’s not the training itself that makes you bigger and stronger. It’s how your body RESPONDS to the training that makes you bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body adapts by responding to what it perceives to be a threat. When you work out, you’re sending your body the message that being forced to lift heavy weights is a “threat” (via stress to your muscles, bones, and connective tissues) that it needs to respond and adapt to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all well and good when lifting is the only major threat your body perceives. It will generally have no issues adapting to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you throw more threats at it? And what are these threats? Anything your body perceives as a significant stressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your body is trying to respond to multiple threats at the same time, it doesn’t respond quite as well to any of them. You can think of it as multitasking. If you’re trying to read a book, play a video game, and work on a project for school or work simultaneously, you won’t retain much of what you read, your kill:death ratio will be horrendous, and you’ll certainly do pretty lousy work on your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the most important threats that keep your body from responding well to training are lack of sleep and chronic life stress, such as a stressful job, a bad relationship, financial worries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going too much into the nuts and bolts of your body’s stress response, it meets these threats by making sure you have plenty of energy floating around your blood stream, available for use to keep you more alert and to make sure you’d be capable of fighting or running away if the situation called for it (for most of human history, those were the two basic ways we responded to most threats, hence the common term “fight or flight” response).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring you have enough available energy to meet these stressors is your body’s primary adaptive response. Most importantly for the context of lifting: This is an inherently catabolic (“breaking down tissue”) process. Your body breaks down stored glycogen and proteins to make sure you have enough available energy to respond to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s bad news for the lifter. Getting bigger and stronger is a fundamentally anabolic (“tissue building”) process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the stress from day-to-day life and lack of sleep tell your body it needs to be in a catabolic state, you’re going to have a hard time carrying out the anabolic process of building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get into the nitty gritty a bit more, there are already articles on Strengtheory about how lack of sleep &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/sleep-pt-1/&quot;&gt;makes it harder to lose fat&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/poor-recovery-and-increased-muscle-breakdown-insufficient-sleep-part-2/&quot;&gt; gain muscle&lt;/a&gt;, and about how&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/stress-the-silent-killer-of-gains/&quot;&gt; chronic stress literally doubles how long it takes you to recover from lifting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right now, we can keep it simple. Training is like having a conversation with your body. You give it the message that it needs to get bigger and stronger via stress on the muscles, bones, and connective tissue. You hope it will respond to that message appropriately. But when stress builds up and you’re not sleeping enough (which is a stressor of its own, which also compounds the effects of whatever chronic stress you’re under), &lt;em&gt;you’re effectively sending your body mixed messages, telling it that it should both tear itself down and build itself up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is something similar to the multitasking scenario from earlier. It doesn’t do a very good job getting bigger and stronger, and the training stress makes you less able to cope with the stressors of day-to-day life and lack of sleep until eventually your body is so worn down that you completely burn out, often resulting in some sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20886307_Stress_Emotion_and_human_immune_function&quot;&gt;sickness or infection&lt;/a&gt;; when your body’s ability to respond to threats is overwhelmed, bacteria or viruses that would usually be stopped cold by your immune system are able to multiply enough that you wind up sick with a cold, flu, or respiratory infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So remember, when you’re trying to tell your body it needs to get stronger, you need to make sure you’re managing your day-to-day stress and sleeping enough, otherwise you’ll get nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Absolute Beginner&#39;s Guide to the Gym</title>
		<link href="https://example.com/posts/beginnergym/"/>
		<updated>2020-08-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<id>https://example.com/posts/beginnergym/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, this is not a post about exercise. This is a post about going to a gym!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice that every once in a while someone asks a question about gyms: joining them, using them, etiquette, etc. I also noticed that there isn&#39;t much about using or accessing gyms in the wiki, so hopefully this gets added (or not, if it&#39;s not useful). If you&#39;re new to getting in shape and want to use a gym for that, I hope this will answer any questions you may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is based on my personal experience, and I&#39;m sure many of you will have &amp;quot;but my gym doesn&#39;t do it this way&amp;quot; comments, so please feel free to comment and I&#39;ll adjust accordingly. Without further ado, let&#39;s talk about gyms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What and why&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gym is a place that makes working out easier. It&#39;s usually a space dedicated to some form of physical activity that allows members to reach their fitness goals. Gyms vary quite drastically in what they offer, how they offer it, what they prioritize, etc. While you don&#39;t have to join a gym to get active or hit your fitness goals, it usually gives you access to equipment and resources you can&#39;t get otherwise (like weights, cardio equipment, pools, personal trainers, etc.). Unless you&#39;re hitting a specific exercise (running or swimming, for example), joining a gym is an easy way to get access to those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different gyms will prioritize different aspects of fitness and well-being. Most large gyms are all-rounders: they try to cater to weightlifters, bodybuilders, yoga enthusiasts, swimmers, runners, etc. Some gyms are more specialized: for example, some may have weights only. Or some might be single function (and probably not be called a gym at all): wall-climbing, yoga studios, Pilates studios, etc. What you join should depend on your goals, and this guide will cover as much as possible to help you decide and navigate the gyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you would find at the gym&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reception&lt;/strong&gt;: almost without fail, there will be a desk at the front where someone will greet you and check that you&#39;re a member before letting you in. The people at the front desk are sometimes also trained as sales people, so they might try to sell you stuff, but once you&#39;re a member, they&#39;re there to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free weights&lt;/strong&gt;: this will be one of the the most common items you&#39;ll find in gyms. The most basic weight option will probably be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tuffstuffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TuffStuff-Evolution-3-Tier-Dumbbell-Rack.jpg&quot;&gt;rack of dumbbells&lt;/a&gt;, but you&#39;ll also see free weights, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.titan.fitness/media/catalog/product/cache/8/thumbnail/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/8/6/86obar-v2-1_3.jpg&quot;&gt;Olympic barbells&lt;/a&gt;, benches, &lt;a href=&quot;https://samsfitness.com.au/image/cache/catalog/atx-fs-240/atx-professional-half-rack-800x800.jpg&quot;&gt;racks&lt;/a&gt;, and all sorts of muscular &lt;a href=&quot;http://5stepmarketing.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gym-owner.jpg&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; hauling these weights around. The variety and scale of equipment depends on the clientele, with some gyms having a much bigger area dedicated to weightlifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ua.all.biz/img/ua/catalog/1949352.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance machines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: these vary greatly in variety and function. Most will have some sort of weight selection, and they will mostly focus on one muscle or muscle group in the workout. While not very popular in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/&quot;&gt;r/Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, they do serve a function and are sometimes necessary (for example, they&#39;re good for back exercises). Some of them will have &lt;a href=&quot;https://5.imimg.com/data5/FC/NY/MY-2277102/lat-pulldown-machine-500x500.jpg&quot;&gt;cables&lt;/a&gt;, some will have complex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fitnessfactoryoutlet.com/images/products/12338.png&quot;&gt;levers&lt;/a&gt;, and almost all will have a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://sep.yimg.com/ay/fitnessgiant/legend-fitness-selectedge-shoulder-press-machine-1101-12.png&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; on how to adjust the machine, how to use it, and which muscles it targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noosaaquaticcentre.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noosa-Aquatic-Gym.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: these are typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://iconfitness-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive,fl_lossy,dpr_1.0,w_800/v1/site-51/NTL17219_gallery_1_L%402x.jpg&quot;&gt;treadmills&lt;/a&gt;, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, rowing machines, and other devices that allow you to perform cardiovascular exercises without changing your location. They&#39;ll more often than not be seen in rows, usually opposite the windows or mirrors. As their name suggests, they help get your heart-rate up. They&#39;re probably the easiest to use, as you probably can run or cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body-weight and suspension area&lt;/strong&gt;: better equipped gyms might also have an area that seems somewhat emptier and allows for more freedom of movement, but might have a device like this &lt;a href=&quot;https://theclublg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TRX_SFrame.jpg&quot;&gt;suspension rack&lt;/a&gt;, and might have the big bouncy balls, or thick ropes attached to racks. These areas are designed for body-weight exercises, and will often attract personal trainers or even small group classes in &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.businessinsider.sg/2018/08/08/5b747cf380eb35045d8b4f36.png&quot;&gt;bootcamp&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studios&lt;/strong&gt;: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dancestudioforfar.co.uk/s/cc_images/cache_8440126.jpg?t=1506983348&quot;&gt;studio&lt;/a&gt; is an area that is somewhat separated from the rest of the gym, usually by glass walls and doors, usually has mirrors on one side, and will sometimes have a stage. Studios are used for things like yoga classes, group exercise classes, etc. You might find yoga mats or exercise balls in there. Some are specialized: they might cycling studios or Pilates studios. Studios are usually open to members if there isn&#39;t an active class, and they&#39;re good for stretching or warming up/cooling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized equipment&lt;/strong&gt;: some gyms have climbing walls, swimming pools, etc. It&#39;s worth asking about these if anything interests you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group exercise classes&lt;/strong&gt;: many gyms offer these classes (Les Mills, Spinning, yoga, Pilates, etc.). These are sometimes part of your membership, and are sometimes extra. You should check with your gym on if they have them and how you can sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender-specific areas&lt;/strong&gt;: other than the obvious ones (showers and bathroom) some gyms might have female-only areas: could be a class, could be a studio, could be a certain time in the week. If you&#39;re female and would a &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; environment, you can always ask about these&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showers &amp;amp; sauna&lt;/strong&gt;: most gyms will have lockers, changing rooms, showers, and some will have hair dryers, ironing boards, saunas, steam rooms, jacuzzis, etc. These are not important to everyone, but a shower might be worth confirming if you&#39;re planning on showering after a workout. Many gyms will also offer towels (a small one to carry around and a big one to dry yourself after showering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal trainers&lt;/strong&gt;: as the name suggests, these individuals dedicate their time to just you in the gym! PT sessions are usually an hour to 90-minutes each, and are designed to help you focus and get better results. PTs are not for everyone. First, they&#39;re expensive. Second, they need you to agree on a predefined time and place to exercise. Third, you might not need them if you&#39;ve been doing this for a while. However, they can be good if you&#39;re an absolute noob and prefer someone to handhold you for the first month or so. PT sessions are sold by the # of sessions, and can used over a specific period. Check with your gym on what options they may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chillout area&lt;/strong&gt;: some of the nicer gyms will have a lounge area, with coffee, a juice bar, etc. available to the members. This isn&#39;t really related to exercise, but having an area like that makes a gym more appealing to some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool, sound like fun! Where do I start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, find a convenient gym. I highly suggest a place that is either near work or near home; anything too far will lead to excuses for not going. You also need to make sure your gym has the equipment/timing/price that&#39;s good for you. Google is your friend (and I guess Yelp). Once you have one or two options, head down before the day you intend to start working out. Walk up to the reception and ask them for a tour of the facilities, and about their pricing options. I suggest you go the gym around the time you intend to work out, to see how busy it is. Don&#39;t forget to see the showers and lockers. Before signing up for a long-term contract, see if you can get a test run (some will give you a 3 day trial, some have one-month options). A one-month option helps you see if a gym is really for you (some people will always prefer to run/cycle/swim outdoors). If there are several gyms that are convenient location-wise, I suggest you see them all before signing any commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small note: while in general gyms and gym-goers are welcoming, some gym environments could be toxic (judgmental, show-offy, superficial). Don&#39;t be discouraged! That&#39;s why I suggest trying a gym out for a month, to make sure the environment is positive and supportive. You need to find a place that you&#39;ll be happy going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, once you&#39;ve settled on the gym, get ready on the day you want to go. Wear some comfortable clothes and shoes, pack a change of clothes (if you need to change), a bottle of water, and head to the gym (I wouldn&#39;t initially worry about things like gloves or wraps; you won&#39;t need those for a while). At the reception, check in and ask for a towel (if the gym provides it), and ask for help for whatever you&#39;re trying to do: if it&#39;s weights, ask them for help with the weight area, cardio, ask for help with the machines, etc. The staff should be able to orient you and give you the basics of the gym. Ask about any special rules (use of chalk, grunting, music, etc., some have funny rules). At this point you should follow whatever program you&#39;ve researched before. Remember, this is not a working out guide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third: shower and change, and congrats! day one is done! Keep in mind that a gym is not the cleanest of environments, so make sure you also wash your bottle, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gym etiquette&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you need to keep in mind is that no one in the gym cares about what you look like, how much you weight, and what exercises you perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, a gym is a common area, so it pays to be considerate. While exercising, observe the room. See how people wait for machines to be ready, how they behave, etc. Look for signs that talk about rules (for example, some gyms limit cardio machine usage ). If you&#39;re unsure about something, ask. Unless they&#39;re in the middle of their workout, most people are more than happy to help. The gym staff are there to help, so always feel free to ask them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weights&lt;/strong&gt;: if you&#39;re weightlifting, you&#39;re going to rest between sets. If the gym is busy, it is good form to share: other people can use the machines/devices/weights while you&#39;re resting between sets. Racks (squat, bench) get busy and sharing helps everyone move more quickly. Quick note: if you&#39;re sharing equipment/machines, and you&#39;re listening to music, male sure you take your headphones/earphones off so you can communicate. You need to hear your buddy. This is especially important if you&#39;re ever spotting someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re using a bench or a seat, it&#39;s good form to place a towel where you might sweat on it, and wipe it down after you&#39;re done. Before grabbing weights from a machine/bar, check to see if someone is still using them (asking won&#39;t harm). Always return your weights to the weight rack. Don&#39;t be the disruptive asshole (grunting loudly, dropping weights). If you&#39;re unsure about something, or need help with an exercise, ask other people who are not actually working out. The big buff guys are probably the nicest as they usually remember what it was like being a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some seasoned lifters in here pointed out that dropping weights and grunting are part of the workout. That&#39;s very true, but doesn&#39;t mean you get to be an asshole about it. Is there rubber on the floor? Is there a deadlift area? Are you grunting in effort or to show off? Again, it&#39;s really about being considerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio&lt;/strong&gt;: observe the time limit if there are people waiting, and wipe your sweat off when you&#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studio use&lt;/strong&gt;: return everything you use in there. Turn off the lights if necessary. Don&#39;t drop weights on the wooden floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body weight area&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure there isn&#39;t a class or someone else using the equipment. If it&#39;s an individual, ask if sharing is ok. If it&#39;s a class, either join in/sign up, or wait for it to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group classes&lt;/strong&gt;: these usually need you sign up early, and your membership needs to include them. Always put your equipment away after the class is done, or wipe your sweat puddle. Think of people using the gym after you.&lt;/p&gt;
